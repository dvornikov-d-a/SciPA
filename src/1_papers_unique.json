There are many modalities for capturing brain images like CT scan (Computed tomography), PET scan (Positron emission tomography) and MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging). MRI is a most important controlled tool for the anatomical judgement of the brain. The classification of cancer in brain MRI is an important task. In the present investigation, there are various techniques used for classification of brain cancer. Under this available image processing technique, classification and feature extraction of brain cancer from MRI images is successfully done. In an initial stage, features are extracted using GLCM technique and features are given as input to SVM classifier. It is observed from the literature that SVM-RBF approach gives better result compare to SVM. Also, SVM-KNN hybrid approach may give a better result because SVM and KNN classifiers give maximum accuracy amongst all image mining approaches. This proposed system is for intellectual classification system for knowledge gathering form MRI image for normal and abnormal brains.","authors":[{"name":"Vaibhavi  Solanki","ids":["52155233"]},{"name":"Ms. Vibha Patel","ids":["47534058"]},{"name":"Ms. Supriya Pati","ids":["52137493"]}],"inCitations":["9da34a0807039144e96d060f2f1fc088e05d380b","de36f3b7d924921bd090527596595443cb6c6733","9e3ce55f59d0a5d7b45fc8e694d9be9cc234b4eb"],"outCitations":["bf9b25f2d5d09524d84ed8a0f0abbdd12d64b311","5d85ce7f198374d30198c54a087cc8a3bf6eabe3","3682a8a2aff6ddf5513d1043d3550389d1c2ed4a","a29d036a4ae91231aca391dfc8b6272bd0f9daf9","9434fa786769068797aa78961cb5810b5c4fee8a","90c3fb9515d6bdbf45e76fb60227abaa5b571f98","a9a6b3d15c1c29d7ff83e650a0c7dc2f3b2df073"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/96f93890dc72f65e7ca41a827918b17dc2b0d6a1","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2018 Second International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication (ICCMC)","journalName":"2018 Second International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication (ICCMC)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"516-519","doi":"10.1109/ICCMC.2018.8487690","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCMC.2018.8487690","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2902124791","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"1d58e1c5a095ad50cc0fbebc9a85c40cd6b5dc24","title":"BRAIN CANCER DETECTION FROM MRI : A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH ( TENSORFLOW )","paperAbstract":"1,2,3,4,5Department Of Computer Engineering, Terna Engineering College, Mumbai University, India ---------------------------------------------------------------------***--------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract Cancer is one of the most harmful disease. MRI is one of the procedures of detecting cancer. Machine learning with image classifier can be used to efficiently detect cancer cells in brain through MRI resulting in saving of valuable time of radiologists and surgeons. This research paper focuses on the use of tensorflow for the detection of brain cancer using MRI. In tensorflow we implemented convolutional neural network with 5 layers. Here total 1800 MRI were used in dataset out of which 900 were cancerous and 900 were non-cancerous. The training accuracy was found to be 99% and validation accuracy was 98.6% in 35 epochs. This system is still in development. The system can be used as a second decision by surgeons and radiologists to detect brain tumor easily and efficiently.","authors":[{"name":"Aaswad  Sawant","ids":["153651212"]},{"name":"Mayur  Bhandari","ids":["93938475"]},{"name":"Ravikumar  Yadav","ids":["153169309"]},{"name":"Rohan  Yele","ids":["153679139"]},{"name":"Sneha  Bendale","ids":["1463526448"]}],"inCitations":["3d4d3e3adbcf1da3f8786bc35e188a3a708e560a","8ff63967d4f83ec6bb41cc3938639569024f1619","4ec47a497296bd9d25b462e1a8dcdcb7467df06f","c82a2ca03ef0f611badbb479f57c4cecddb5335f","d7761cc4ff1b89742170f5a4f89a277ed5c678a4","38721dc91fde4dce0d4d606f6bb9e4145bf56eff","51810f4d8277bc7d9bd3493307019e1e50ea48a5","1cffeb0817828362916ab52b1ac064ccc7e1fcc8","fd8d3600520d38b03426a88c219d171647a5299a","698d8a77da33a3fe02de0ba221959aeeaeed1940"],"outCitations":["dd54c27acce16e3687b63562f7e917f0ad00f2ac","5536cab1dc415430bfe393309ac88557fbb0bd7e","f547ac43e0cc56d8869514596066458c07485255","05305a2100e2a7489c87d71ea4f3f5f303347f56","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","eab1540a465b06d242c67facf18d9062183d7044","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","d6eb184902897a3fd04bc5f08691612d678831ce","33ed82eeba0218e6c961af574d5c88481a168d88"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1d58e1c5a095ad50cc0fbebc9a85c40cd6b5dc24","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2969992205","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"90c3fb9515d6bdbf45e76fb60227abaa5b571f98","title":"MRI brain cancer classification using hybrid classifier (SVM-KNN)","paperAbstract":"This paper proposes an intellectual classification system to recognize normal and abnormal MRI brain images.

The system uses computer based procedures to detect tumor blocks or lesions and classify the type of tumor using Artificial Neural Network in MRI images of different patients with Astrocytoma type of brain tumors. The image processing techniques such as histogram equalization, image segmentation, image enhancement, morphological operations and feature extraction have been developed for detection of the brain tumor in the MRI images of the cancer affected patients. The extraction of texture features in the detected tumor has been achieved by using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). These features are compared with the stored features in the Knowledge Base. Finally a Neuro Fuzzy Classifier has been developed to recognize different types of brain cancers. The whole system has been tested in two phases firstly Learning/Training Phase and secondly Recognition/Testing Phase. The known MRI images of affected brain cancer patients obtained from Radiology Department of Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) were used to train the system. The unknown samples of brain cancer affected MRI images are also obtained from TMH and were used to test the system.

affected patients are taken for classification of brain cancer. Image processing techniques are used for processing the MRI images which are image preprocessing, image segmentation and feature extraction is used. We extract the Texture feature of segmented image by using Gray Level Co- occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Steps involve for brain cancer classification are taking the MRI images, remove the noise by using image pre-processing, applying the segmentation method which isolate the tumor region from rest part of the MRI image by setting the pixel value 1 to tumor region and 0 to rest of the region, after this feature extraction technique has been applied for extracting texture feature and feature are stored in knowledge based, this features are used for classification of new MRI images taken for testing by comparing the feature of new images with stored features. We implemented three classifiers to classify the brain cancer, first classifier is back propagation neural network which perform classification in two phase which are training phase and testing phase, second classifier is the combination of PCA and BPNN means by using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of feature matrix and by using BPNN to classify the brain cancer, third classifier is Principle Component Analysis which reduce the dimensionality of dataset and perform classification. And finally compare the performance of that classifiers.","authors":[{"name":"Ganesh Ram Nayak","ids":["73717128"]}],"inCitations":["9dd8450044bc96e1f4731898e87928b28ac8e067","9228893be2eae5ab2acf74a23d96fec8ed09ea46","e8427855a86373917dfec75a43031f4352e444fb","de0870616122edc43331c5f2275a8a5c8221a6ed","8ea0500cd4949327a14b7a4996a80ca039929747"],"outCitations":["7628d73c73b8ae20c6cf866ce0865a1fb64612a3","8e76c9a23920c46aae4bd4ea0c34742f218580bc","4f7e760e7af7698c00d9a0d23e5fa760862d8bde","5c6ef8c44dc84d6e47600adf4459a777e9a2b46a","ac1fd24c7e55274e25dde3b5958a6304118f388a","bf7c1aa96674791c2ef5ce25346957bd09195631","6ae3070dcfb800de9385e5c684f4ce78dc947f52","de997e108d48b30f25b36712aefa24b9e666868c","732e1de5ba6e294f129030e3d9c922c56f4a4b0f","8e1110bbf6093655ce6ac28ed621484e950af707"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a0f33b59c68c87af6624055a27f77cf782d9a48d","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ijtra.com/view/brain-cancer-classification-using-back-propagation-neural-network-and-principle-component-analysis.pdf?paper=brain-cancer-classification-using-back-propagation-neural-network-and-principle-component-analysis.pdf","http://www.ijtra.com/view/brain-cancer-classification-using-back-propagation-neural-network-and-principle-component-analysis.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2181566033","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"c3b42d2b94ea468a28aecece2da91f76104295e1","title":"Literature Survey on Detection of lumps in brain","paperAbstract":"Broadly, to produce images of soft tissue of human body, MRI images are used by experts. In medical research field faces the challenge of identifying brain lumps or cancer or tumor through Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). For brain lumps or cancer detection, image segmentation is required. Systematizing this process is a tricky task because of the high diversity in the appearance of lumps tissues among different patients and in many cases similarity with the usual tissues. Physical segmentation of medical image by the radiologist is a monotonous and prolonged process. MRI is a highly developed medical imaging method providing rich information about the person soft-tissue structure. There are varied brain lumps recognition and segmentation methods to detect and segment a brain lumps from MRI images. This is well thought-out to be one of the most significant but tricky part of the process of detecting brain lumps. A variety of algorithms were developed for segmentation of MRI images by using different tools and methods. Alternatively this paper presents a comprehensive review of the methods and techniques used to detect brain lumps through MRI image.","authors":[{"name":"Pritam R.

Brain tumour is the main cause of brain cancer. A tumour can be defined as any mass caused by abnormal or uncontrolled growth of cells. This mass of tumour grows within the skull, due to which normal brain activity is hampered. Which is if not detected in earlier stage, can take away the person's life. Hence, it is very important to detect the brain tumour as early as possible. For detection of brain tumour, first we have to read the MRI image of brain and then we can apply segmentation on the image. But in the MRI brain image, some confidential information of patient's is always there. To apply segmentation, this unnecessary information has to be removed, as it can be considered as noise. Here we present an efficient method for removing noise from the MRI image of brain using Region Filling method.","authors":[{"name":"Daizy  Deb","ids":["72254660"]},{"name":"Bahnishikha  Dutta","ids":["48901265"]},{"name":"Sudipta  Roy","ids":["47115751"]}],"inCitations":["afecf65ca8df66cdad1bb5b615c856ddfc0cd04d","99ad3febc370adb49b63378cdd6e695a3b4b379d","f86de13441ad467461a6d1666916d88b8c5b8351","1b7128de3d652245f2b491c6a7bab7e3c858d055"],"outCitations":["0b9d799aa69e9e0b1e35ba5662d46fd8de9d7ffe","36727e5f1169ead3f7a72d763c016f328d92cca8","926a4743a432e3b230ff7f2a06e652cc6a652807","a7cb1e37a7d0306bb174898fca4ba52a52cb280c","ae68948d2f0d2b4e9eb107f6af1d67066c0c6fdf","e90b01ea0e3936cff68680b57ffcb20d567502e5","26a2f5733159227727e553e199f2da48a9f323f6","9b445929f53fe804c475a4352eafbde30858aca2","365a9053e8281186f83785744de34f2aad84ba76","cecb7feec5ccfbb2608e5991396fe3fac08896c8","0ed25bdb77ebc3c6140c5709bebf3c7d1a5d968b","143a7ae3da78c655669c8dd5748e630afbc41393","aff87bbf331637722b4210f0133ff190164530d2","e19d7045599b2a0bb975789d8f7593ebdfddfee0","77eb5bd199de98adedf17d1db45fb4d3fef74388","b731bead104a8a7fef72ee29d465d9baadbb4fbe"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/77bbe78295cdbe8d8b787b3768e8e59e886e4686","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communications, Control and Computing Technologies","journalName":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communications, Control and Computing Technologies","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1403-1406","doi":"10.1109/ICACCCT.2014.7019331","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCCT.2014.7019331","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2057768929","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"94e565e4a396f52f4ff525eb90e061ffafd45307","title":"BRAIN TUMOUR DETECTION AND SEGMENTATION","paperAbstract":"Brain tumour is an abnormal growth caused by cells reproducing themselves in an uncontrolled manner.

Tumour exists as a mass in the brain. Hence detection of the tumour is more important before providing the respective treatment. This paper deals with improved system for brain tumour detection and classification. Medical imaging is an essential phase in the detection of malignancy within the human body. In case of cancer, imaging becomes inevitable as the mode of treatment itself relies on nature of the tumour. The fundamental modalities employed in clinic includes the Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In CT scan images due to poor soft tissue contrast, extraction of the tumour segment becomes difficult and it is also challenging to detect lesions. As with ultrasound it cannot be used for detection of cancer and lacks accuracy. Hence MRI images are taken into consideration which overcomes these limitations and allows functional imaging. By using MRI, cancer staging can also be determined. An MRI image of the brain tumour is taken as the input which is segmented and classified sequentially. Each step employs well defined algorithms paving its way to provide accurate results even for haphazard MRI images. It bates the problem of analysing the poor quality MRI images. Segmentation method using adaptive k-means clustering divides the MRI image into multiple segments from which a meaningful extract of the brain tumour is obtained. Finally, the segmented image is classified using Support Vector Machine classifier. This classifier determines the type of the tumour. When three kernel functions of the SVM classifier is compared, the linear kernel yields the result with higher accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"P. Sharath Chander","ids":["2088958979"]},{"name":"J.

CT scans, X-Ray, and MRI scans are the common imaging methods among magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that are the most reliable and secure. MRI detects every minute objects. Our paper aims to focus on the use of different techniques for the discovery of brain cancer using brain MRI. In this study, we performed pre-processing using the adaptive bilateral filter (ABF) for removal of the noises that are present in an MR image. This was followed by the binary thresholding and Fuzzy Recurrent Neural Network (FR-Net) segmentation techniques for reliable detection of the tumor region. Training, testing, and validation datasets are used. Based on our machine, we will predict whether the subject has a brain tumor or not.

MRI is more advantageous than other modes of medical imaging technology in many application fields and meanwhile, the accurate and robust brain MR image segmentation, feature extraction and classification are very important for clinical cancer diagnosis. A new cancer diagnosis method for brain MR image is proposed. The adoption of MR image to extract brain tumor GMM feature algorithm is proposed and realized. The technologies such as multi-threshold segmentation, brain tumor GMM feature calculation and extraction and the discrimination between brain tumor and normal part based on decision tree classifier are used in brain tumor identification or diagnosis. MR image simulation results based on brain tumor test proves that the extraction technology by GMM feature obtains the expected results. The preliminary experimental results indicate that the method performs well in cancer cell and brain tumor test. The capacity of the method is reflected in its higher precision than other algorithms in brain tumor test.","authors":[{"name":"Huan  Deng","ids":["2072970140"]},{"name":"Chen-peng  Shi","ids":["2762201"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9bff4aeff67902669a6cb84c19ff43e767707ab1","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"Journal of Residuals Science & Technology","journalVolume":"13","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2625619892","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"cbcb172ff907f38897000c8ef332f40bc1169059","title":"Artificial Neural Network based Brain Cancer Analysis and Classification","paperAbstract":"Brain Cancer is very serious disease causing deaths of many individuals.

An automatic and effective BTS system is therefore required. Nevertheless, tumor detection remains a challenging task for researchers as the tumor has complex appearance and boundary features. This paper seeks to explain BT, its forms and various methods of brain tumor identification and segmentation. The aim of this survey paper is to present different automated brain MRI BTS methods.

Since the manual segmentation of brain tumours is laborious, the development of semi-automatic or automatic brain tumour segmentation methods makes enormous demands on researchers [1]. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition protocols are standard image modalities that are used clinically. Many previous studies have shown that the multimodal MRI protocols can be used to identify brain tumours for treatment strategy, as the different image contrasts of these MRI protocols can be used to extract important complementary information. The multimodal MRI protocols include T2-weighted fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T1-weighted (T1), T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1c) and T2-weighted (T2).","authors":[{"name":"Hai Thanh Le","ids":["2064731593"]},{"name":"Hien Thi-Thu Pham","ids":["49976487"]}],"inCitations":["01bcdcaa0739bbed0cede1eef963b4271542a939","64c414e97a443d786b899d68ff12683be775d2f9","7cb22e3911a511886e61ae614f7c132e0d68a069","4ef5f1beb189f245c621e605fdf95ba84f58758b","d74fd2e27a8578a082d7986cf52dad63d0543546","231fd859bffed032314d80035a06d0e605c0e0b8","6924047517dd4d61b50b12146f1d56f15a491a13"],"outCitations":["4d376d6978dad0374edfa6709c9556b42d3594d3","ba6961160c10bab1b37b89dbee65d91133ba4acf","7c2bcf6f32b05a04cd3444c030db743e5666af88","50432703c89002134deff6a07691b5cc4a53a694","2abde28f75a9135c8ed7c50ea16b7b9e49da0c09","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","6d03a38c5ddb7c7cd1ceb59b28907dc918c5d83a","3bda8b8dd09117f7d5abc12cf4581ac50b6412ee","d3d829caabdec20bc43c38e90b51b8d29444c20f","102ed1e9b785caec1cb69c043dbda7b2cfa2d57d","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","7db8e4204931967288fe34c8f8e9dd51196615b0","6a4c6ac19d12da7857a2b620e5f8e778f22b732e","e0067a9c3f30aab46d9e6f8844dc36e83c85869f","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","9d3a5c83548ee6b905cde59ab3090aebac273306","c83c72d26ca8d4152150f1ccbbb180542662cdfa","8c85a978c23e953a7384f5e0cd86324204d61108"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/72d985b03b65499d5c0ff65b1f6550f5e5e37369","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://vietnamscience.vn/index.php/VJSTE/article/download/141/115/"],"venue":"","journalName":"Vietnam Journal of Science and Technology","journalVolume":"60","journalPages":"19-25","doi":"10.31276/VJSTE.60(3).19","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.31276/VJSTE.60%283%29.19","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2890020259","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"61f577c71e725b57665411128ad1ff5b11dfef7f","title":"Brain tumor detection from MRI images using deep learning techniques","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor is the growth of abnormal cells in brain some of which may leads to cancer.

MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) based CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) system which takes MRI as input and detects abnormal tissues (Tumors). MRI is the safe and well reputed imaging methodology for prediction of tumors. MRI modality assists the medical team in diagnosis and proper treatment plan (Medication/Surgery) of different types of abnormalities in the soft tissues of the human body. This paper proposes a framework for brain cancer detection and classification. The tumor is segmented using a semi-automatic segmentation algorithm in which the threshold values selection for head and cancer regions are premeditated automatically. Segmented tumors are further sectioned into malignant and benign using SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier. Detailed experimental work indicates that our proposed CAD system achieves higher accuracy for the analysis of brain MRI analysis.","authors":[{"name":"Qoseen  Zahra","ids":["1581605488"]},{"name":"Muhammad Sheraz Arshad Malik","ids":["8519392"]},{"name":"Naila  Batool","ids":["10755543"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["879fc413ebc138db1121fa5ab93b230205a4c1a6","1f6eafc6e108e2a0f1a14332c1a32feb9e97f0d8","305f6b5178ec079d4245c8dd8e6a482e0da31355","6aeb17f02edf4b6ebc72549e34dba8aadbe8bf19","7c754e48b461965e737ba1d885281243f76f8a42","fc52373e23093b0a84f9e5b3c860c799999fba2c","726bf31d32b7e591091153b623310ba6451ad030","1b688a2191c5ddd02d7b2bb828255a57d2f50ef4","580b4d0652f8858d03132b19d6a3023333e45b04","2f2d91ba982a88a6941303cc443def88a318a528","151fc7ac51d1ab8f24e38d18cbc3ec7bf2a7cccd","6c7ab36e903e4e542ccdd7ccd0889d1e1a1223bb","ef6a1c870e263144df13223b0cf48adddf957051","e935aa2a5248961e59dfd1990d45f46f590b31a3","e6971ef43e1285f9437cb95ec0ee2d06490253d4","354bc4feb49ad644aef60590e605de9e359e73ee","714fa50674458f07ee9eeea9d2182a670a0bd88e","cf234320b8a20411bb04479a5a6e852f6cdc8940","bd5d67bc40ec7ee6bad6c6ca045028533bf6647c","d307b814bf39c2bce16140b7aa0e73e9e7cbf2e9","a1b2be49b4ab77de64157e2d477799f43e503452","225d5409a6000856a10fdb141d40fb9973ab7e31","98873dfa8e1ec1185c584a2cb4eb514223ec2d77","2141dc0f6f07a0c4fd5caab351d39407f1f7abd3","df25b6e02572c63f03e6da4f89587d291c59e6af","5bd34f60889c33aba677c7c123e6d4dbb86b8350"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0cbfa2e86caf1b6f759f2c1c0966a81fb4b708db","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://publications.muet.edu.pk/index.php/muetrj/article/download/1151/361"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"38","journalPages":"835-850","doi":"10.22581/muet1982.1903.24","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22581/muet1982.1903.24","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3006136949","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"d4f4222c5844af5d4809de786aba64dadf00dbac","title":"Noise Detection and Noise Removal Techniques in Medical Images","paperAbstract":"In this experimental work we have taken different medical images like MRI, Cancer, X-ray, and Brain and we have calculated standard derivations and mean of all these medical images after finding Gaussian noise and then we have applied median filtering technique for removal of noise.

Brain diseases like brain tumor is characterized as a gathering of abnormal cells that becomes inside the brain and around the brain.There are various imaging techniques which are used for brain tumor detection. Among all imaging technique, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is widely used for the brain tumor detection. MRI is safe, fast and non-invasive imaging technique. The early detection of brain diseases is very important, for that CAD (Computer-aided-diagnosis) systems are used. The proposed scheme develops a new CAD system in which pulse-coupled neural network is used for the brain tumor segmentation from MRI images. After segmentation, for feature extraction the Discrete Wavelet Transform and Curvelet Transform are employed separately. Subsequently, both PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) have been applied individually for feature reduction. A standard dataset of 101 brain MRI images (14 normal and 87 abnormal) is utilized to validate the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the suggested scheme achieves better result than the state-of-the-art techniques with a very less number of features.","authors":[{"name":"Vijendra  Prasad","ids":["2052179414"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["dab0f5870f744e9e006c73fab7938583f8c26a63","cce66b0c73d4be34c4de07a7f899d3f750863971","fc52373e23093b0a84f9e5b3c860c799999fba2c","a53e6431e3e9151ebe6564d7f4777131a5ef690e","d4fcf51f3e355c27afe690f60ba3160ef96d5dd5","d464bfbf14fb5383e7adc0a99e9280816c0acd57","d9fbfc0708868b9811070aeb8a1fd7d025e3bc26","bd5d67bc40ec7ee6bad6c6ca045028533bf6647c","ed09211bca6c8b4e97deab9328e24fc026c02b62","03d67da60612e60692b0bfdac1eedadc0a98905d","51c849cde080ed6ffc03089cebc504cafa3d23e7"],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1d4c888475b17dca7c2c47c689685a5910b526a2","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ethesis.nitrkl.ac.in/8316/1/2016_MT_214CS1127_Automated.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2595776958","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"e70f90c8e6d47612c2e53bcbbd0eab2022b74e7e","title":"TUMOR REGION EXTRACTION USING EDGE DETECTION METHOD IN BRAIN MRI IMAGE","paperAbstract":"The segmentation of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is a complex problem in the field of medical imaging despite the various methods presented.

The analysis of asymmetry of the brain is of great importance because not only is it an indicator of brain cancer, but it also predicts a future potential risk for it. In our work, we have concentrated to segment the anatomical region of the brain, divide the two halves of the brain and detect each half to detect the presence of a tumor.

To date, automated brain tumor segmentation from MRI modalities remains a sensitive, computationally expensive, and a demanding task. This paper presents an automated and robust segmentation method to enable investigators to make successful diagnosis and planning of radiosurgery by reducing the risk factor and study duration. The proposed system consists of following steps: (1) remove the non-brain part from MRI, (2) estimate saliency map of MRI, (3) use the salient region (tumor) as an identification marker and segment the salient object by finding the “optimal” closed contour around the tumor. The system has been tested on real patient images with excellent results. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations by comparing with ground truths and with other existing approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","authors":[{"name":"Irfan  Mehmood","ids":["3330588"]},{"name":"Ran  Baik","ids":["2993869"]},{"name":"Sung Wook Baik","ids":["1777998"]}],"inCitations":["26ff4223ea5f25f04b7e349b0edde1e4dee12ef5","0dc908aff5cd5ca5b7beb150ab8cb8b5f825b1cc","64ff7bae344f6a93597827c378e93e388109f223","6bf1d591bcfd4c29e8c2f5f457fa9fd59fee9225","df25b6e02572c63f03e6da4f89587d291c59e6af"],"outCitations":["356da61c67114eef6478dcb4452244b8e9c544ab","320ebfefbeec68665104c38811891fc1037d0b78","24294b431d75dee4f47c48b4e4c84aae9fe02c68","225d5409a6000856a10fdb141d40fb9973ab7e31","005eddda6f315e0078324ab6e0e4376a24f768c9","510ca89dafa2c434f130fdd7c456ece10b9967a7","3a35746fa5e848c785ad9b9d986d58f5a951bf5e","f28bbf6c3fa4653580d5ba780fd6736a0bae7e26","e1fd1e4c52506b69c888c5f5f050363e44e22c65","28eb47f734827e62a480c9259113d461e5630713","dfc389f5acca4a0a6e1ddc172bab43ae6465cfa4"],"year":2012,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a59b87bd40db32ad2b7364fb63761939fcbaeb9c","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57581780"],"venue":"ICITCS","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"537-544","doi":"10.1007/978-94-007-5860-5_64","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-5860-5_64","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"1040930068","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"b9ac57413c386dba6aa1e7e3cb20e15158d4b09c","title":"Neural network with bee colony optimization for MRI brain cancer image classification","paperAbstract":"B rain tumor is one of the foremost causes for the increase in mortality among children and adults. Computer visions are being used by doctors to analysis and diagnose the medical problems. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique, which is used to visualize internal structures of MRI brain images for analyzing normal and abnormal prototypes of brain while diagnosing. It is a non\"invasive method to take picture of brain and the surrounding images. Image processing techniques are used to extract meaningful information from medical images for the purpose of diagnosis and prognosis. Raw MRI brain images are not suitable for processing and analysis since noise and low contrast affect the quality of the MRI images. The classification of MRI brain images is emphasized in this paper for cancer diagnosis. It can consist of four steps: Pre\"processing, identification of region of interest, feature extraction and classification. For improving quality of the image, partial differential equations method is proposed and its result is compared with other methods such as block analysis method, opening by reconstruction method and histogram equalization method using statistical parameters such as carrier signal to ratio, peak signal\"to\"ratio, structural similarity index measure, figure of merit, mean square error. The enhanced image is converted into bi\"level image, which is utilized for sharpening the regions and filling the gaps in the binarized image using morphological operators. Region of Interest (ROI) is identified by applying region growing method for extorting the five features. The classification is performed based on the extracted image feature to determine whether the brain image is normal or abnormal and it is also, introduced hybridization of Neural Network (NN) with bee colony optimization for the classification and estimation of cancer affect on given MRI image. The performance of the proposed classifier is compared with traditional NN classifier using statistical measures such as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The experiment is conducted over 100 MRI brain images.","authors":[{"name":"Sathya  Subramaniam","ids":["31799770"]},{"name":"Manavalan  Radhakrishnan","ids":["29916697"]}],"inCitations":["796a16149e05259153c26f3cf3ac9ca48f97ce35","8681af3f30af01227aa08367f22547203d1edc97","a2377eb4cc12d9d7e635db98bac39728c285231d","3aa5e40e6ea8545edb91cd35b637e9eb5b58fba0","d95b87bb367c83db1afb6b22f7fe16297503f700","c01a44aea7dee182538c6186be9662fa4360ca36","37fcee4caed048ee17b23fba58354894e8d046fb","2cc1bcb716f1931261570b2388fc69e5a530519b","9e3acc7b7317503a12e35d0baafcd3b7e924a754","86af686577e96cf5925c0a398a0510f4863f7246","ab3ca81120f9b6fa8ebb8c5a2bf1a6493a63a38b","817dc79a7e1eab9b2ba1c567c892afb309982d1c","760cf9e70f12e94da1e8ff99a18da8978ead096e","5a5ddad9d3c99bc1a986e69838ae0ffa9d9c3d17"],"outCitations":["702e844c0347c98622ead4bfcff7665b75047e8f","30e19057204a5807472c09eba11c8fa87fc0fb84","496c3d75b81b336411e53da1ac632a8139655604","cc8125a5baf488e7af6ac896cbc70d826a2b2652","6e12d10eec04c7fe2593d89e1351e65c535638b4","2ea7f283b895dddd21d7123ee1538dbf230935c0","4b6206884811cabaa170735a737c307847fa19cc","6a8122861b80842ee6f406acdeec35aec913f1b8","dd5125d940f180a7264999ef6a7d8ad430508d9e","b9aeb9d457f4c7a2090036eae8ec32738535c117","f26b8385f4c760b561b2342fc08249fcfc1bdd1e","186c8f883ec452d76018d3bb5aa132b79e8f5d45","91fdf06a8c1aa1799071411319813059adbc5cc4","24ba38356f59911982a6a8a9aa702db27f00d92b","365a9053e8281186f83785744de34f2aad84ba76"],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b9ac57413c386dba6aa1e7e3cb20e15158d4b09c","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://iajit.org/index.php?Itemid=383&id=102&option=com_content&task=blogcategory","http://ccis2k.org/iajit/PDF/vol.13","no.1/5084.pdf"],"venue":"Int.

Advances in natural language processing (NLP) allow for the development of accurate automated protocol assignment. We aim to develop, evaluate, and deploy an NLP model that automates protocol assignment, given the clinician indication text. Methods We collected 7139 spine MRI protocols (routine or contrast) and 990 head MRI protocols (routine brain, contrast brain, or other) from a single institution. Protocols were split into training (n = 4997 for spine MRI; n = 839 for head MRI), validation (n = 1071 for spine MRI, fivefold cross-validation used for head MRI), and test (n = 1071 for spine MRI; n = 151 for head MRI) sets. fastText and XGBoost were used to develop 2 NLP models to classify spine and head MRI protocols, respectively. A Flask-based web app was developed to be deployed via Heroku. Results The spine MRI model had an accuracy of 83.38% and a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.8873. The head MRI model had an accuracy of 85.43% with a routine brain protocol ROC-AUC of 0.9463 and contrast brain protocol ROC-AUC of 0.9284. Cancer, infectious, and inflammatory related keywords were associated with contrast administration. Structural anatomic abnormalities and stroke/altered mental status were indicative of routine spine and brain MRI, respectively. Error analysis revealed increasing the sample size may improve performance for head MRI protocols. A web version of the model is provided for demonstration and deployment.

Brain cancer is the deadliest cancer and requires image/signal processing approaches to record and analyze the illness sections. In this work, Bat algorithm (BA)-supported practice is executed to extract cancer region from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Initially, Kapur’s entropy-based multi-thresholding is applied on the brain MRI database. Subsequently, the tumor region is segmented using the Chan–Vese active contour (CVAC) approach. The competence and the importance of employed method are confirmed by means of the picture likeliness values and the arithmetical measures. Experimental result of this study verifies that present approach offers superior values of picture likeliness and arithmetical measures on the considered database.","authors":[{"name":"K.

Early diagnosis of brain tumors plays an important role in improving treatment possibilities and increases the survival rate of the patients. Manual segmentation of the brain tumors for cancer diagnosis, from large amount of MRI images generated in clinical routine, is a difficult and time consuming task. There is a need for automatic brain tumor image segmentation. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods. Recently, automatic segmentation using deep learning methods proved popular since these methods achieve the state-of-the-art results and can address this problem better than other methods. Deep learning methods can also enable efficient processing and objective evaluation of the large amounts of MRI-based image data. There are number of existing review papers, focusing on traditional methods for MRI-based brain tumor image segmentation. Different than others, in this paper, we focus on the recent trend of deep learning methods in this field. First, an introduction to brain tumors and methods for brain tumor segmentation is given. Then, the state-of-the-art algorithms with a focus on recent trend of deep learning methods are discussed. Finally, an assessment of the current state is presented and future developments to standardize MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods into daily clinical routine are

Machine","paperAbstract":"This research paper proposes an intelligent classification technique to recognize normal and abnormal MRI brain image. Medical image like ECG, MRI and CT-scan images are important way to diagnose disease of human being efficiently. The manual analysis of tumor based on visual inspection by radiologist/physician is the conventional method, which may lead to wrong classification when a large number of MRIs are to be analyzed. To avoid the human error, an automated intelligent classification system is proposed which caters the need for classification of image. One of the major causes of death among people is Brain tumor. The chances of survival can be increased if the tumor is detected correctly at its early stage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique is used for the study of the human brain. In this research work, classification techniques based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) are proposed and applied to brain image classification. In this paper feature extraction from MRI Images will be carried out by gray scale, symmetrical and texture features.

Diagnosis","paperAbstract":"Accurate segmentation of brain tumor plays a key role in the diagnosis of brain tumor. Preset and precise diagnosis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain tumor is enormously significant for medical analysis. During the last years many methods have been proposed. In this research, a novel fuzzy approach has been proposed to classify a given MRI brain image as normal or cancer label and the intensity of the disease. The applied method first employed feature selection algorithms to extract features from images, and then followed by applying a median filter to reduce the dimensions of features. The brain MRI offers a valuable method to perform pre-and-post surgical evaluations, which are keys to define procedures and to verify their effects. The reduced dimension was submitted to a diagnosis algorithm. We retrospectively investigated a total of 19 treatment plans, each of whom has CT simulation and MRI images acquired during pretreatment. The dose distributions of the same treatment plans were calculated on original CT simulation images as ground truth, as well as on pseudo CT images generated from MRI images. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is promising.","authors":[{"name":"Aref  Safari","ids":["2064175150"]},{"name":"Danial  Barazandeh","ids":["1581458263"]},{"name":"Seyed Ali Khalegh Pour","ids":["89780353"]}],"inCitations":["281923fce70cc8ca8408860945abb6b634dcf839"],"outCitations":["7609a834e4bc4bbe01eec2d83a0f63a4b2ce4570","7d5aedecdfc4e8f83638bac47eb7cf2f860ec51c","0c63dbeb4b542044444d87106e3ee3369561983c","51256786adc028ced3bb1a727c1980f19ccdef98","b5889ad4f30c89c039ed63b5944d6f52570d223e","2e7e34a0422cc68ce18bab63079d4424b79e1ac3","6bd462b3968c64410432dca27067234e321430b0","3c75fa075a0e4ceb4e8648a96af3771f29371562","3b8968ee454c38fa8dffe66da5a26d296fd07cc8","6d70fab86c14502025a109e31754d1e61682563e","67624826c910dbfe41cf513d01b6d0cc34798531","26ee9287993d7c6324f9705a5eec850f53e58617"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/df433adaf40f0871ac3d50f4f3223925130862ed","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://jacet.srbiau.ac.ir/article_14980_4dd222e5440a2d6c1cac826aaf4ed9a7.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"6","journalPages":"19-24","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2994667944","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"2a46994544fcdab33b5af0460fa40af5e931ccdd","title":"REVIEW ON DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR BRAIN TUMOR GLIOMA ANALYSIS","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor diagnosis has evolved as a very critical need in current medical diagnosis. Early diagnosis of tumor detection is an important need for the primitive treatment of brain tumor patient increasing the survival rate of patient. MRI diagnosis of brain tumor for cancer treatment is a large processing due to volumetric content of scan sample. The processing of clinical data is large and consumes a high processing time. Hence, the need of early diagnosis and proper segmentation of brain tumor region is in need. This paper outlines a review on the developments of MRI sample processing for early diagnosis for brain tumor glioma diagnosis using deep learning approach. The advantage of learning capability and finer processing efficiency has gained an advantage in MRI image processing, which enable a better processing efficiency and accuracy in early diagnosis. Deep learning approach has shown a benefit of image coding based on selective features and state of art processing in diagnosis. The evaluation objective of the MRI sample processing has shown a better accuracy than the comparative existing approaches.  The recent trends, the advantages and limitation of the existing approach for MRI diagnosis is outlined.","authors":[{"name":"Mrs. Disha Sushant Wankhede, Dr. Selvarani Rangasamy","ids":["2124251612"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["075f20200b132dc4e851a042e5f78fbdc8872221","12dc0a361824473a8c02e3a0a895bb7a5ecc1b94","a840d9a8fc03f312740baad4e19e39348901b0f7","648092c5278f5596b73a2cad80b347ea9897f181","304ff026e8e8a02b219a03deff10d67d5b505c8a","281f110ec34acafc71f81ee64b2ccac748b92379","b0dac601a9fc416d40ddfd49f2ed26f563561a09","b8504d447d358f48bc9e6b2d32314809794889c1","55916b5b38a7c763b5b12468fcd65c93ba1fccc4","3b3526de1cc4ebd0f0f8a07508b4295f7b9eda96","2cebf0212380f83b7171fb5660f842c8d7043f60","976050a0d225313224bd74f1608d20c5ac35577f","6e15e66899c7e86bc99ae210b6110d0b12fde731","af4245f18ef768e16e7b8ca9ec41a12f9c8d2bfb","b1328df3c0d1262d500ed734f8bf977094c3b087","9e3828153a29fa66bae7edb53d2702128aac2e96","7da5c56244847c9c16f9e68915bbe52486a620b4","297e3210c7d3b175ec6ef955f682d5e63a00f46b","6530f3dd82b4e63db5eba226a8bba1aa683efe78","d85b5fee4fe3a8034a0e6aedadb01892898626fd","af5e216c1728cb2ec4a3d665945019a39554782a","e320f0f0b47fbadac1692c1acd002d554b5c670b","0e4cbdbd7dd3ce56426f788ccc795ec5de3a4677","1a0f52819cd13406bec85fd59620dd72cd11005a","a9058777e859f6256d1e11766bbd0a68f2d0c1bc","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","d8c6761cb923a33170a3f5a1be30a09070e174d4","cdef0566c012cced2f5c9fc4f86321f7ce1a9216","2b7e304cb528d255d862e804bf3893612a38af8e","88d8040019f01c6cb1b064194585327654035432","99b0ccaee542b1b42e32167a313cccb2e479e465","9a62a16cc95ed3ffcaf963904ff0ed70fb99fa5a","e3297d40d2e8a8c32e476665cc1a5866c960d7b3","ed8a5b4b1114605e4dac4eecb6d99fed694226a7","6d58b2f1c04d34ff777f9f70d85dc9bf3fccec2f","ad4cb63dca1459f3196236d991d608e13aa284c4","39ddc2bf5f267c1268fffdc6c0a6d119fa54a155","8f126ebe3691c6e00400867500dd6218c4c33b89","001e24066da134829c03c690c66ae4c702be08d7","a82934cf1029fba7bb0c318f395aa869f163eaed","592d0275ac42bf711098af89a2585e69a960567f","e4c721fb8a5e6774b22cecd7d84aee94a5319579","89d4eaf0b38523322c891ed159229ae89f2aaaef","4f6ea4034c2ac7e770c5fad522483a8d9308904c","dc13942fd8cae11770966fe3ac85c6fded382c66","a01cb2cebe010d3c930aeb8cd02f6ac6c9efed8a","68dd0001849efd875d5a865c2c0962f9cc2efc75","42da69bcf8ef8a94d0005b8f0c1d04e4519373af","191027b362a4dc39f30fddca221adca697eec7fd","2582b49b71073b46dea6b1390c32cd58db5c467e","131102baeae6609594c5a7483834af1c1f66c9b7","3bae16550c6bb15995d8af4eedbc394e497fe9e0","a77f74ab128aa68d79c457e632d3d237a819b6ca","67c8fe68952afdb04758bdf4eac8ceba8ac5207d","7c3a4996315609f7f4080300127af5b42deac5a8","5038eabefad5cfaa606d3085c1654f697fb509fb","7018bdb88ad6d74e8c429b390bb24b320d1aa3da","e2c26692f58afb5b7bb142c75dc2e9fce3b05c98","b436f68ec2d05f08119c6eecc6336fe24bffd714","60a1d00c1941c6802e2522c4ec5ea5f6f5ab7d93"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2a46994544fcdab33b5af0460fa40af5e931ccdd","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://it-in-industry.org/index.php/itii/article/download/144/129"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"9","journalPages":"395-408","doi":"10.17762/ITII.V9I1.144","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17762/ITII.V9I1.144","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3139402745","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"ebaf6bacb9be64d74e3887b0e37a7b3386638082","title":"Histogram Equalization for Image Enhancement Using MRI Brain Images","paperAbstract":"Medical image processing plays an essential role in providing information in wide area for such advanced images.

The segmentation processes of Magnetic resonance images (MRI) play a crucial role in detecting brain tumors. Since the large amounts of MRI images are generated during the cancer diagnosis, manual image segmentation will be a tedious job due to time constraints. An automatic image segmentation processes can alleviate the former limitation. There are various algorithms used to segment the images automatically, in which the deep learning technique is more efficiently used for large amount of images to find the size and location of a cancer. Enormous review papers have been published to give insight on MRI-based image segmentation. Our review is focused on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning algorithm, as it gives better accuracy in image recognition problems.","authors":[{"name":"K.

A surgical intervention is the first treatment as it improves the prognosis of the patient. Unfortunately, this type of tumor is aggressive, and difficult to remove completely, which makes the resection surgery more challenging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most used screening technique for brain cancer diagnosis and surgery planning as it provides detailed information about the tumor's location and size. In this paper, we propose a system for the reconstruction of three-dimensional brain models containing a glioblastoma tumors using the Microsoft headset HoloLens. The developed mixed-reality system projects and overlaps the 3D brain model from the MRI images onto the patient's head during the surgery. This system has the potential to simplify the surgery, reduce the surgery high-risk, increase the resection precision, and help remove the tumor tissue as much as possible.","authors":[{"name":"Khaoula Belhaj Soulami","ids":["7298520"]},{"name":"Elias  Ghribi","ids":["1396325014"]},{"name":"Yassin  Labyed","ids":["1805385"]},{"name":"Mohamed Nabil Saidi","ids":["1700242"]},{"name":"Ahmed  Tamtaoui","ids":["2772976"]},{"name":"Naima  Kaabouch","ids":["1735112"]}],"inCitations":["3ceedd418557b0f437163eee5bad24250a32c101","003f4c0da3004c25a193e97c7901bf89d28601cb"],"outCitations":["64d67f62887eb1d429f55cd0c7537e9c3e819072","8dfd92747c2ffd39d14af8a6cb189a981a53ddf4","3225a5b34792b11095236af623c00aa3fda12408","6c4e0adb16590e835ac54375ea5884336b8fd6d1","0d6cd9a4a8428bdc9ee0a58bb338a2147d8e5add","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","a44bb6fce4cadcd47d8cbe1c6dd5b92f9535bc13","a045817cfc790376a25a62c60655875243dd1898","42aff2c4b3b90cffb1edda9248021a1a7925deb3","8fb2f1b55ded770ae8e7637157b476ba1ae1ad4f","ad84d8ce1c03968786eb1537df8f5ba35bfc2ec5","e4b17209bfffb5809810c87fbb2079cb9263f7d0","55d4642bde4a38b3670bd8119749c3475e4a7808","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/65ff8e4143d440e814ec6052d594837055474ac9","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2019.8833738"],"venue":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (EIT)","journalName":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (EIT)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"079-084","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2019.8833738","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2019.8833738","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Computer Science"],"magId":"2972611399","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"c4d4842f64a2463c9697af35808e1e923bea949b","title":"Segmentation of MRI images for brain cancer detection","paperAbstract":"Brain cancer detection without human interference is a major challenge in the field of medical image processing. Segmentation of MRI brain images is a technique used as a first step towards extracting different features from these images for analyzing, interpreting and understanding. The objective of MRI brain segmentation is to detect the type of brain abnormality. Many segmentation techniques have been proposed in the literature. These techniques use Gaussian distribution to estimate the image threshold. Gaussian distribution assumes that the histogram of the image has symmetric distribution. However, if the histogram is non-symmetric, a more generic distribution, i.e. a Gamma distribution, must be used. The aim of this paper is to enhance Li's method that has been proved good for image segmentation, by using Between-Class Variance with Gamma distributions. The proposed method will be tested on MRI brain images. Experiments show good results for our enhanced segmentation formula.","authors":[{"name":"Wassim  El Hajj Chehade","ids":["1410542615"]},{"name":"Riham Abdel Kader","ids":["2683215"]},{"name":"Ali  El-Zaart","ids":["3149198"]}],"inCitations":["56bd46a9914de5d48a86c8f4d759aee8ca5d5cd6","25e366b76c8fa425ec037a68b18a285b725e9add","efc230d7f67df1f7d68d59e9d228c0287ea4b83d","31be05d75df0dfef512a006555a26336b352d731","8bf20f28c823f8e6d1e390f6881d7012aa338587"],"outCitations":["5410d3cbaebce000d47c248f24da4ba1d9d66db7","eceba4e34a3037559ad63dcba68f17780d948375","4dafbbc0cd8eb3e9967dd6b8bfce216a4dd3c1fc","207cf6f958896c6074d08e950aa9106422e0bcf3","1cd4f88fc18a1d6921d4a8bf187910421d38190f","1d4816c612e38dac86f2149af667a5581686cdef","171e4055d74bfb33d6a4cee7ca0592ed69fa9875","181dabd38ce8e2fdd32308e4be82820e3b86be35","aabf87e3787885244ffd739c176d1dea34e13189","b7fc096b797165c8b00cb6049c5188dc8137b0df","edf94b9459b751916dcbaa4c94805586886aef64","6c6238a8b6f01031be8429a7cf0565d99448f56a"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c4d4842f64a2463c9697af35808e1e923bea949b","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2018 International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","journalName":"2018 International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"929-934","doi":"10.1109/ICOIACT.2018.8350721","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIACT.2018.8350721","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2798924936","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"0a0541389a6b239d0e8247cc03e7979d23398df1","title":"Synergetic neuro-fuzzy feature selection and classification of brain tumors","paperAbstract":"Brain tumors constitute one of the deadliest forms of cancers, with a high mortality rate. Of these, Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults. Tumor biopsy being challenging for brain tumor patients, noninvasive techniques like imaging play an important role in the process of brain cancer detection, diagnosis and prognosis; particularly using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Therefore, development of advanced extraction and selection strategies of quantitative MRI features become necessary for noninvasively predicting and grading the tumors. In this paper we extract 56 three-dimensional quantitative MRI features, related to tumor image intensities, shape and texture, from 254 brain tumor patients.

In light of evolution, it is a priority to inspect the cancer system from a time-domain perspective since it explicitly tracks the dynamics of cancer variations. In this paper, we study the problem of exploring brain tumor heterogeneity from temporal clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Our goal is to discover evidence-based knowledge from such temporal imaging data, where multiple clinical MRI scans from Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients are generated during therapy. In particular, we propose a quantitative histogram-based approach that builds a prediction model to measure the difference in histograms obtained from pre- and post-treatment. The study could significantly assist radiologists by providing a metric to identify distinctive patterns within each tumor, which is crucial for the goal of providing patient-specific treatments. We examine the proposed approach for a practical application - clinical survival group prediction. Experimental results show that our approach achieved 90.91% accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"Mu  Zhou","ids":["48993866"]},{"name":"Lawrence O. Hall","ids":["25887296"]},{"name":"Dmitry B.

In the past decades, the brain tumor is detected using computeraided systems i.e. MRI Scan. The Analysis of brain tumor from MRI images has become anefflorescent research area in the domain of medical imaging systems. The MRI images have anadvantage of high image resolution and it is also independent of ionizing radiation. Imageprocessing concepts can visualize the different anatomy structure of the tumor by locating thetumorous part and examining its intensity. MRI images play a vital role in radiology makingthe process more enduring and tedious with the increase in data. These MRI images must beprocessed with the utmost care since a small glitch in the outcome of MRI images is fatal. Thefunctioning of the nervous system is inversely proportional to the growth rate of the braintumor. To overcome this problem, Convolutional Neural Network approach for brain tumorclassification is implemented here. The Deep neural network is able to pull out requiredfeatures from the input and tumors are classified. Initially, the MRI images are pre- processed,RGB converted, image augmentation is performed and fed into the neural network. By usingResNet architecture an accuracy of 98% is achieved.","authors":[{"name":"A  Anand","ids":["1629535997"]},{"name":"K  Ridhuparan","ids":["2042018658"]},{"name":"G S Karthik","ids":["145373324"]},{"name":"R Sooraj Veer","ids":["2072102240"]},{"name":"V Raghu Prasath","ids":["153465257"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1ef84de21a252191a86b4f7b571c667774de666a","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"Solid State Technology","journalVolume":"63","journalPages":"5639-5649","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3107442977","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"d1ac4807aaf291969ed397ac6e4a7299138a250a","title":"Brain Cancer Classification Using GLCM Based Feature Extraction in Artificial Neural Network","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor is one of the major reasons of death among people.

The methylation status of the promoter or the enhancer regions of the O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) gene may impact the efficacy and sensitivity of temozolomide, and hence may affect overall patient survival. Microscopic genetic changes may manifest as macroscopic morphological changes in the brain tumors that can be detected using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can serve as noninvasive biomarkers for determining methylation of MGMT regulatory regions. In this research, we use a compendium of brain MRI scans of GBM patients collected from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) combined with methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to predict the methylation state of the MGMT regulatory regions in these patients. Our approach relies on a bi-directional convolutional recurrent neural network architecture (CRNN) that leverages the spatial aspects of these 3-dimensional MRI scans. Our CRNN obtains an accuracy of 67% on the validation data and 62% on the test data, with precision and recall both at 67%, suggesting the existence of MRI features that may complement existing markers for GBM patient stratification and prognosis. We have additionally presented our model via a novel neural network visualization platform, which we have developed to improve interpretability of deep learning MRI-based classification models.","authors":[{"name":"Lichy  Han","ids":["4820261"]},{"name":"Maulik R.

Segmentation of images holds an important position in the area of image processing. There are lots of methods for automatic and semi- automatic image classification, though most of them fail because of unknown noise, poor image contrast, inhomogeneity and boundaries that are usual in medical images. Image processing has become an area of boundless possibilities to explore as the advances in research field in this domain are gaining momentum. Brain tumour detection is a crucial task these days.

Among all other types of cancer, the mortality rate of brain cancer is the highest. The MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) brain images need to be accurately classified into different grades for better treatment decision. Astrocytoma is one of the common type of glioma brain tumors, comprises 34% of brain tumor. In the proposed system, Astrocytoma MRI images is preprocessed using PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) and median filter. Three class FCM (Fuzzy Clustering Means) thresholding is used for successful segmentation. From the features obtained from DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform), texture features are extracted using Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GL-CM). Shape attributes are extracted by manipulating Canny edge detection algorithm. Training set consists of feature vectors created from 400 images from two grades of tumor. Classification of 100 test data into different grade is done using classifiers such as Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF NN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN).","authors":[{"name":"S  Suja","ids":["144173436"]},{"name":"Nimmy  George","ids":["32651397"]},{"name":"Annie  George","ids":["143765698"]}],"inCitations":["004a7f01ccedef997dd73ba6e55bb852878c46ae","3cef4e956785fd78d477cb0029a6410b2f1f4c4d"],"outCitations":["9e950dfba5df3ecd86a5be5d7b08442a39e0c114","e7e245cf1e9508b82138f2b406f14cc7ca7884ea","778d32a0f93c779d1c6a57c0d08cc2017d32146b","b009bc3c853ecfa6acb8b23533d0cc93f6c0da21","168e38db0ce3ac895a37f39a19677c3cfa91a0ac","2b5f731652f8e1d4eeb7e6834caf9badb973d7eb","5c6ef8c44dc84d6e47600adf4459a777e9a2b46a","408368be03680615e49f07780813da8c7f803a69","03d67da60612e60692b0bfdac1eedadc0a98905d","c83c72d26ca8d4152150f1ccbbb180542662cdfa","9434fa786769068797aa78961cb5810b5c4fee8a"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3e045a4c7146472b06bacedc454306de32c314a","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2018 2nd International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI)","journalName":"2018 2nd International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1257-1262","doi":"10.1109/ICOEI.2018.8553882","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOEI.2018.8553882","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2902893486","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"7ec85550a41532a44921e5956141f9947b5ab9e3","title":"BAT Algorithm With fuzzy C-Ordered Means (BAFCOM) Clustering Segmentation and Enhanced Capsule Networks (ECN) for Brain Cancer MRI Images Classification","paperAbstract":"Cancer is a second foremost life-threatening disease next to cardiovascular diseases. In particular, brain cancer holds the least rate of survival than all other cancer types. The categorization of a brain tumor depends upon the various factors such as texture, shape and location. The medical experts have preferred the appropriate treatment to the patients, based on the accurate identification of tumor type. The process of segmenting the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has high complicacy during the analysis of brain tumor, owing to its variable shape, location, size, and texture. The physicians and radiologists can easily detect and categorize the tumors if there exists a system by combining Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI). An approach of automated segmentation has proposed in this paper, which enables the segmentation of tumor out of MRI images, besides enhances the efficiency of segmentation and classification. The initial functions of this approach include preprocessing and segmentation processes for segmenting tumor or tissue of benign and malignant by expanding a range of data and clustering. A modern learning-based approach has suggested in this study, in order to process the automated segmentation in multimodal MRI images to identify brain tumor, hence the clustering algorithm of Bat Algorithm with Fuzzy C-Ordered Means (BAFCOM) has recommended segmenting the tumor. The Bat Algorithm calculates the initial centroids and distance within the pixels in the clustering algorithm of BAFCOM, which also acquires the tumor through determining the distance among tumor Region of Interest (RoI) and non-tumor RoI. Afterwards, the MRI image has analyzed by the Enhanced Capsule Networks (ECN) method to categorize it as normal and brain tumor. Ultimately, the algorithm of ECN has assessed the performance of proposed approach by distinguishing the two categories of the tumor over MRI images, besides the suggested ECN classifier has assessed by the measurement factors of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In addition, the genetic algorithm has applied to process the automatic tumor stage classification, which in turn classification accuracy enhanced.","authors":[{"name":"Afnan M.

Multimodal image registration is significantly more complicated than registration of images from the same modality or protocol on account of difficulty in quantifying similarity between different structural and functional information, and also due to possible physical deformations resulting from the data acquisition process. The COFEMI technique for feature ensemble selection and combination has been previously demonstrated to improve rigid registration performance over intensity-based MI for images of dissimilar modalities with visible intensity artifacts. Hence, we present here the natural extension of feature ensembles for driving automated non-rigid image registration in our new technique termed Collection of Image-derived Non-linear Attributes for Registration Using Splines (COLLINARUS). Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the COLLINARUS scheme is performed on several sets of real multimodal prostate images and synthetic multiprotocol brain images. Multimodal (histology and MRI) prostate image registration is performed for 6 clinical data sets comprising a total of 21 groups of in vivo structural (T2-w) MRI, functional dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, and ex vivo WMH images with cancer present. Our method determines a non-linear transformation to align WMH with the high resolution in vivo T2-w MRI, followed by mapping of the histopathologic cancer extent onto the T2-w MRI. The cancer extent is then mapped from T2-w MRI onto DCE-MRI using the combined non-rigid and affine transformations determined by the registration. Evaluation of prostate registration is performed by comparison with the 3 time point (3TP) representation of functional DCE data, which provides an independent estimate of cancer extent. The set of synthetic multiprotocol images, acquired from the BrainWeb Simulated Brain Database, comprises 11 pairs of T1-w and proton density (PD) MRI of the brain. Following the application of a known warping to misalign the images, non-rigid registration was then performed to recover the original, correct alignment of each image pair. Quantitative evaluation of brain registration was performed by direct comparison of (1) the recovered deformation field to the applied field and (2) the original undeformed and recovered PD MRI. For each of the data sets, COLLINARUS is compared with the MI-driven counterpart of the B-spline technique. In each of the quantitative experiments, registration accuracy was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) for COLLINARUS compared with MI-driven B-spline registration. Over 11 slices, the mean absolute error in the deformation field recovered by COLLINARUS was found to be 0.8830 mm.","authors":[{"name":"Jonathan  Chappelow","ids":["2439089"]},{"name":"B.

Image processing is a tool for identifying the substances and obtaining information from them. Medical image processing is a stimulating area to diagnose diseases specifically, brain cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, neuro- and cardio-diseases, etc. Image segmentation is an act of segregating the images into various parts to identify a particular substance and its margins. Brain tumor is the irregular and intense growth of tissues causing cancer. The most used technique to diagnose brain tumor is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Precise information about the affected area is crucial for the appropriate treatment. As numerous data are created in MRI diagnosis, an automated segmentation technique is necessary to obtain precise information of tumor. In this paper we presented Depth-First Search (DFS) segmentation algorithm based on graph theory. Here the image pixels are arranged into a tree like structure based on their proximity in the image. The experimental results are compared with other existing systems. Also performance measures of ANFIS classifier and SVM classifier are compared. It distinguishes healthy cells from the cells affected by brain tumors. In the proposed method, the computational complexity is reduced and accuracy is enhanced.","authors":[{"name":"S.

Clinically brain tumors are categorized into 2 types, tumor that grow by themselves (primary) and the result of metastases or spread of cancer cell from other organs (secondary) . Primary tumor consists of several types, but the most numerous and malignant is Glioblastoma. The difference between Metastatic tumor and high grade Glioblastoma will be more difficult if the origin tumor is not known. The limitations of distinguishing Glioblastoma and Metastatic from MRI cause clinical dilemmas because both have different advanced treatments. Therefore the author done a research that can help and facilitate the process of classification of primary and secondary tumor based on MRI digital image processing. The neural network method used for classification in this study is Extreme Learning Machine. For feature extraction Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix is used. The training process in this study used 70 MRI images and for the testing process used 30 MRI images.

The most common misdiagnosed type of cancers are brain tumors. Patients in early stages of brain tumors often present with vague symptoms. Due to the ambiguous nature of symptoms, diagnosis is difficult and the delay in diagnosis leads to a poor prognosis. In MRI images, brain tumors are hard to classify since they are embedded near normal tissues. This makes it hard for doctors to exactly extract tumors. Recognition of tumors in MRI images is tedious and time-consuming in most cases. To assist this process, several machine learning techniques have been developed. However, the techniques have limitations in practical diagnosis: Supervised techniques need a human operator to choose training data, while unsupervised techniques can only segment images without recognizing tumors. In this thesis research, we developed a hybrid technique for automatic brain MRI tumor recognition. This technique may overcome some limitations of the existing techniques as it does not require the involvement of a human operator and can effectively recognize tumors.","authors":[{"name":"Omar Irfan Khan","ids":["2065986982"]}],"inCitations":["0a39a9ec80c0f7245a8f7cbe4217bd22c65543ae"],"outCitations":["84f2a000ec32f9394ca6cd823c5cf724be9b5a9b","db7a9caf3b472624dcd07e614874f03ad2926092","c83c72d26ca8d4152150f1ccbbb180542662cdfa","652fe612fefcc5810ef2b5635a4f2d90616483ca","bbce6747d79b3caf31ca77d33a3a9ef023ffd04b","3e32d7bf1dacd4b9246d891c61207a4caea91573","acd2e0ba8ac0fce8116c359a68db24d0e42ecb58","630ceb73780a0842720b564eda02c04c5e32bd4a","be54cf7bd4451b01ce1657673b65e15ecaf138d6","fbbd3381640dae2ca4b03ac7ed85bfec896929b8","f38a69c657bbb7927ef032049c9ea9ba17322b15","660557cdeac23e391f8dba5e1d535d40fd0a6015","cd3aac8020cedc0008ed515f35abcc1352680c35","c143194ad48e134040c19bbd8b3329f126db8c34","6070378afd1b2b0d42d6bb52ccafac025d5d361c","890664d6e7861253bd8c36d0e9079f96c9f22d67","128e4eb6f85a8936c61a61c69ef58ed27c18c67b","9a130df3ea64ba3974e412e5344ea5a45d47f325","4e4210d40eb97c03b87260c613abe404e926a82e","4df6d7a0cbb230a446589dcb65ea0b09446b15b7","370ff80fcafce482337327333cb9bf26f17af8c0","1d6d1221343383bcc9bd7e005bf084fc06ab2660","706bfdaffb2c66415ca9fe74edf574d2d0476f59","6edebe72678d4151cc169f1e47154098ab9d3f6b","1f419146ef08534c23f642e0136dcd73321ace43","4e607b44337fe7160cb4f4ce153332c7e53964a7","00a44f089188bd293a5483d46f2c3cf1f6aabc4a","168f28ac3c8c7ea63bf7ed25f2288e8b67e2fe74","1d4816c612e38dac86f2149af667a5581686cdef","327c7aed94bde61e6b72d81afc3556558024268c","ee2f83dda70083357b22c7da1e887d7c18e316e4","276543b44716f4d2d8bafd87f4943fe994ca7e4e","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","cce66b0c73d4be34c4de07a7f899d3f750863971","9a0ef2e00a28623c49b695ec6088ea1d965db257","0cc79d572ecb479629f61c36f9d382f95524eac1","dfd5af043c9596085bfffc62a7c81456eaaf90c9","f36c495c83ff6bd9d471bc5dda7ed50e1e4c8115","2034af7588f735d4d5d4690b734692e20345c657","524649acda67d492ba8fa24d06c2438893c2dae6","d572c95d7273e96f0004e348464c0c19030bcff7","1ef4716cdd786d55aef8b2c9cb9a82c98add7e8a","e421b4c06fdc1bc47dd8d5a776c5aa9e7268084b","cd14baab40e4ec51052be6b190ddbf0c3ebdaf5f","4477f379ae4c23af443bd290074b1cd1eccdc503","6bd462b3968c64410432dca27067234e321430b0","05447ad7c0bc55f8b3766e23da1578bb13f46bbf","09193e19b59fc8f05bee9d6efbfb1607ca5b6501","8d82925550395b5b545eae4475222b215ad149fb","a0127cf6ce8ebab5528cbe33d5b16464e6ff11da","a7b47e91483692166eb55b9a7ace73fcf2dd60f9","420f3f1078a6d8e0696572c032877079286051c6","de997e108d48b30f25b36712aefa24b9e666868c","51998b463768f9d756f48b4138b5ca149eadc132","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","28b21a79c9843e61e87b9a87216b755a1f8fa26b","9394a5d5adcb626128b6a42c8810b9505a3c6487","6f9824741513bdd79031f1dfde978fddc91dee19","fd560a77a76897e13ae1f1d219102c72597a11cd","a2bf50825812b2f5d59e11b38345c4dca02279ac","fc433b8590be34d8652af3c7fae690a3753ddb92","0cca1fa6cf2ac8d9e43d5d7d69f96fc178000c2a","3cc94460f4259d04b65663bd996d7ac9e2e38ed2","4cb8a0a9f5d860038c3fe28a3fbe8c7f704abbbc","e6426709ee096a62ea8e592f422f849bae172b2e","9fd62b2f8c94fcff878f20e441c4a04ea5727430","c19f02ce4eaab610d7fa44cf04864d65768b772c","5ec92913d6fd750871728b956f7c23e792d44ceb","6fb13081e034b919f52b30a1b953328349c0c877","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","0003cef29c64620b7d962d20b6939b286124ef46","2d690403162911c95b0dee9d0a7b3b31710ab80f","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","72188af628875c7df7b5fa32e848bd77f762a035","1e8f93128fe7241cdad29a052a3b87ab068d4108","94c2db8bd4435035de62bfb4b85d5e53107c90fd","0430b241bdd0b67d37e1143370f8d24fc46d83e9","2cebf0212380f83b7171fb5660f842c8d7043f60","97efa3acd4a45b28f3c9e25c961a9379abdc811b","3bda8b8dd09117f7d5abc12cf4581ac50b6412ee","21eac8b9491b92718222fb53b34abd8346fa9d5e","32ce875b1eeda8215e3dfb9ad05ff94eb656c41e","5038eabefad5cfaa606d3085c1654f697fb509fb","811ed8e46cadf76819187220bc626828cce11986","0185c309306cbd72f54d757414cc8eb2825314d5","79342f7a229ec6c78fddb1a04f9304dffdab8e9e","10dc12419ac8ff24556cd9ead75c27a6a8b52f5d","24ceee33cdc8afa977134a5332c7e399413e2f91"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b5bc98e5881b8189417124770e21cf590d7a9b66","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://atrium2.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10214/17779/Khan_OmarIrfan_202001_MSc.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=5"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3005045095","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"788ed6e8393baa81ee08b23422fac0a3c10b4e84","title":"MRI brain tumor segmentation: A forthright image processing approach","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor is a collection of cells that grow in an abnormal and uncontrollable way. It may affect the regular function of the brain since it grows inside the skull region. As a brain tumor can be possibly led to cancer, early detection in Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanned images are crucial. Thus, this paper proposed a forthright image processing approach towards detection and localization of brain tumor region The approach consists of a few stages such as pre-processing, edge detection and segmentation. The pre-processing stage converts the original image into a greyscale image, and noise removal if necessary. Next, the image is enhanced using image enhancement techniques. It is then followed by edge detection using Sobel and Canny algorithms. Finally, the segmentation is applied to highlight the tumor with morphological operations towards the affected region in the MRI images. The in-depth analysis is measured using a confusion matrix. From the results, it signifies that the proposed approach is capable to provide decent segmentation of brain tumor from various MRI brain images.","authors":[{"name":"Noor Elaiza Abd Khalid","ids":["2848373"]},{"name":"Muhammad Hazim Firdaus Ismail","ids":["2004167025"]},{"name":"Muhammad Azri Ab Manaf","ids":["2006485707"]},{"name":"Ahmad Firdaus Ahmad Fadzil","ids":["50304125"]},{"name":"Shafaf  Ibrahim","ids":["3304561"]}],"inCitations":["7f2cd6113a0732bc67f4629f8b72f531b24e4e3b","c7d43c78a60a3ce9eb74dbe3960f252bce9f018e","1e051844ab398f2d7ead781449856518fbb02ab0"],"outCitations":["b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","a4a998489f8bb4b31f565045552943b799e72950","c40f98f93c0a25dd624f41f746d9b09e00410953","82b793b582f92e7a559adb2ce45baebc9e3d1d65","48ca7ec53e542e135fc685dba93232f5e8578d6f","efb644f2e25378b11028cfb917ad525afbec9fdc","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","de20f67d1a42d167b025c9198bec76659bf1f8ed","53fd9cf896095ebc4d6aaaf9a179d1914036cb53","282078d456d056eacb9a7f67994e0e7d88e04b14","56ea8f4ccda27b49b02f012d1bfcfc237b4a251f","d84b51650ff22a0a8a77ca8b6a32bf62df448132","412cbc1ed04b38399db2008bc7f9f05c8dce472e","5269b197c2d7fea31fae4a46691f0c33a041d4a3","82ab07eb8e28abd0c4b0e59ed56e5d5a79c122a2","bfd387d75de4e9c610799a848eace7fd3c278522","d90726a935065edb5c07f3541efe9ea9be376d54","97c3efeaa7ddcc4e6130d5502ff4a088b6ff544d","b7449194b22fb27f90f7587c966fb30cf3f6e796","266157d16597440bf434015f3177f328a9082fa9","b354db3691d55ce2bbb7c88a14972fab2317434b","77a95fa3eddd814d8ce5ef8c3ff93164ad7a847a","eac5e7f530182749f3c25d4b8ef212e84a12ef8c"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/788ed6e8393baa81ee08b23422fac0a3c10b4e84","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://beei.org/index.php/EEI/article/download/2063/1429"],"venue":"","journalName":"Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics","journalVolume":"9","journalPages":"1024-1031","doi":"10.11591/EEI.V9I3.2063","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11591/EEI.V9I3.2063","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2997733537","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"4793eb144b62dfcc231397bbb5bbfd63e92aa100","title":"Automatic Detection of Arterial Voxels in Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MR Images of the Brain","paperAbstract":"Arterial input function (AIF) is important for the determination of cerebral blood flow and the analysis of related disease. Detection of artery voxels in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is the key challenge in estimating the AIF. In the presence of tumour tissue, automatic detection of arteries becomes as even more challenging task. In this paper we propose a supervised machine-learning based method for the detection of artery voxels in DCE-MRI of the brain. The method utilises a set of kinetic and local structural features with a logistic regression classifier in order to detect arterial voxels in the image. The performance of the method is evaluated on 11 DCE-MRI datasets, of patients with diagnosed brain cancer, in terms of area under the ROC curve and in terms of correlation with an ideal AIF. The results of the evaluation suggest that the proposed method has the potential to be used as a tool for accurate estimation of AIF in DCE-MRI of the brain.","authors":[{"name":"Sze Liang Stanley Chan","ids":["2687848"]},{"name":"Yaniv  Gal","ids":["1869980"]}],"inCitations":["49246646fb8bd255ac6e942703fba5a9162db59f"],"outCitations":["02790aacdfc8159c089cde39651c48a64c3a8abb","3d73d051970d375b5ddb3d22f6bed2e91cf11a3f","454ad65e94b885c3f577576c910821cece5e2179","cc289a923cd3be2a4a57f86e34986d509b8f7217","e11e8de22fb98086a97e3de2c62b7102f14a248c","b2391612ef6e32a4fdba68ccf6b8b051dbd7f261","3d70655c35c0e9a823969b345920f31c8f9f590c","53804ca63a45bae8def72f49270e4b4c8965c7c3","3eb29868a9e577cca8ebc06bc32b4f7ee28903b7","279047d3c351eb20f158656724844b6ded247ffc","10d85561e4aafc516d10064f30dff05b41f70afe","c256954d0c8839101d4d1b4b7b94d325afb8653f","79101b3254ae68e2f7d67ddef3e1f05ebb48de5e","3626f388371b678b2f02f6eefc44fa5abc53ceb3","b4d4655c8440d2a7e19971644729273168230981","b992336681135bd3e013a2c12b01dbbc3a469af2","48ddd9101a90fe65e3061de69626741b843ff5e4"],"year":2012,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4793eb144b62dfcc231397bbb5bbfd63e92aa100","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2012.6411710"],"venue":"2012 International Conference on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","journalName":"2012 International Conference on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-7","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2012.6411710","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2012.6411710","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2017863681","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"8752b778004979bf7ed0a0521a4d90b2188530b2","title":"MRI Images Segmentation and 3D Reconstruction for Cerebral Cancer Detection","paperAbstract":"Cancer is a dense and an abnormal rapid multiplication (proliferation) of cells in the tissues of the human body. The brain tumor is one of the most dangerous and deadly tumors. Fortunately, the evolution of science has allowed us to create very efficient medical imaging techniques in order to discover this type of cancer. Chief among these techniques is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is a very efficient technique compared to ultrasound. In this work, we are interested in the detection of this type of cancer allowing a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of MRI images. The segmentation methods used are based primarily on the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm that classifies and isolates parts of the brain tissue, and secondly on Distance Regularized Level Set Evolution technique for tumor detection. The obtained results show the effectiveness of this approach to detect brain tumor. The 3D reconstruction is finally carried out to better visualize the tumor as a whole and to detect its expansion. It is conducted using an indirect volume rendering method, which is the Marching Cubes algorithm.","authors":[{"name":"Nadia Smaoui Zghal","ids":["40466763"]},{"name":"Nabil  Derbel","ids":["1770657"]}],"inCitations":["22f5813787cb9198ff37f577f9edceebc91ecab5"],"outCitations":[],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8752b778004979bf7ed0a0521a4d90b2188530b2","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"Journal of Testing and Evaluation","journalVolume":"46","journalPages":"20170309","doi":"10.1520/JTE20170309","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1520/JTE20170309","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2802278749","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"eec80428c8b445c4285865f4993e6239049adb2b","title":"Endothelin B receptors targeted by iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with a specific antibody: toward immunoimaging of brain tumors.","paperAbstract":"In this study, we developed a new bimodal imaging tracer directed against endothelin B receptors to detect brain cancer cells using MRI and to assist tumor surgery with fluorescence imaging.

The risks involved in carrying out surgery within such a complex organ can cause severe anxiety in cancer patients. However, neurosurgery, which remains one of the more effective ways of treating brain tumors focused in a confined volume, can have a tremendously increased success rate if the appropriate imaging modality is used for complete tumor removal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent soft-tissue contrast and is the imaging modality of choice for brain tumor imaging. MRI combined with continuum soft robotics has immense potential to be the revolutionary treatment technique in the field of brain cancer. It eliminates the concern of hand tremor and guarantees a more precise procedure. One of the prototypes of Minimally Invasive Neurosurgical Intracranial Robot (MINIR-II), which can be classified as a continuum soft robot, consists of a snake-like body made of three segments of rapid prototyped plastic springs. It provides improved dexterity with higher degrees of freedom and independent joint control. It is MRI-compatible, allowing surgeons to track and determine the real-time location of the robot relative to the brain tumor target. The robot was manufactured in a single piece using rapid prototyping technology at a low cost, allowing it to disposable after each use. MINIR-II has two DOFs at each segment with both joints controlled by two pairs of MRI-compatible SMA spring actuators. Preliminary motion tests have been carried out using vision-tracking method and the robot was able to move to different positions based on user commands.","authors":[{"name":"Yeongjin  Kim","ids":["2271379"]},{"name":"Shing Shin Cheng","ids":["21594385"]},{"name":"Jaydev P.

Hybrid imaging devices such as PET/MRI can provide both functional PET image and higher definition morphologic image. In this study, first of all, we proposed a MRI guided PET filtering method by adapting a recently proposed local linear model and then incorporated PVE into the model to get a new partial volume correction (PVC) method without parcellation of MRI. The performance of the proposed methods were investigated with simulated dynamic FDG brain dataset and 18F-FDG brain data of a cervical cancer patient acquired with simultaneous hybrid PET/MR scanner. The initial simulation results demonstrated that MRI guided PET image filtering can produce less noisy image than traditional Gaussian filtering (GF) and bias and coefficient of variation (COV) can be further reduced by MRI guided PET PVC . In addition, structures can be much better delineated in MRI guided PET PVC with real brain data.","authors":[{"name":"Jianhua  Yan","ids":["46759043"]},{"name":"Jason Chu-Shern Lim","ids":["49719095"]},{"name":"David W.

Researchers are trying to develop methods and treatments to round it. Brain tumor is an exceptional cell enhancement in brain tissue and may not always be seen in imaging tricks. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a technique which is applied to display the detailed image of the attacked brain location. The medical imaging trick plays a significant behavior in identification of the disease. In this paper, the brain MRI image is chosen to investigate and a method is targeted for more clear view of the location attacked by tumor. An MRI abnormal brain images as input in the introduced method, Anisotropic filtering for noise removal, SVM classifier for segmentation and morphological operations for separating the affected area from normal one are the key stages if the presented method. Attaining clear MRI images of the brain are the base of this method. The classification of the intensities of the pixels on the filtered image identifies the tumor. Experimental result showed that the SVM has obtained 83% accuracy in segmentation.

Early detection is widely preferred to offer better treatment in order to save the patient. In the literature, considerable procedures are proposed and implemented by the researchers. In the proposed work, heuristic approach assisted automated procedure is proposed to segment and analyze the tumor region from the brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). Combination of the Bat Algorithm and Kapur’s Entropy is chosen as the initial processing section to improve the visibility of tumor region and the Active Contour (AC) is then chosen as the final processing section to extract the tumor of brain MRI image. Simulation test was executed on the gray scaled brain images obtained from the literature. The reputation of the proposed approach is confirmed against the ground truths supplied by the expert members. The eminence of the proposed procedure is confirmed by computing the image likeliness measures and the area measures. From the results of the experimental work, it can be noted that, the proposed approach offers better result on the gray scaled brain MRI image. Finally, the clinical significance by contributing superior values of image similarity and statistical measure values.

Although accurate tumor segmentation by radiologists is ideal, it is extremely tedious. Experience shows that for MRI database indexing purposes approximate segmentations can be adequate. In this paper, we propose a straightforward, real-time technique to find a bounding box around the brain abnormality in an MR image. Our algorithm exploits left-to-right symmetry of the brain structure. The proposed detection algorithm can play a useful role in indexing and storage of bulk MRI data, as well as provide an initial step or seed to assist algorithms designed to find accurate tumor boundaries.","authors":[{"name":"N.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality which plays a pivotal role in the prognostic and therapeutic assessment of a wide range of disorders with its availability of broad spectrum of contrast mechanisms. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) are two such significant contrast mechanisms of MRI. DCE-MRI helps to differentiate tumour tissues from surrounding tissues. DW-MRI models like Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) are used in understanding the complex cellular micro-structures noninvasively. In this research, the main goal is focussed towards reconstruction of DCE-MRI and DW-MRI. Additionally, we aimed to show the potential of DW-MRI on human brain studies. DCE-MRI needs images with high spatial and temporal resolution. These conflicting requirements are challenging due to the inherent limitations of the MR modality. A section of the thesis addresses the issue of high spatio-temporal resolution using customized sampling strategy and reconstruction. Our proposed method reconstructs high quality images from under-sampled dynamic k-space data by proposing 2 main improvements; i) design of an adaptive k-space sampling lattice and ii) Edge-Enhanced Compressed Sensing based reconstruction technique. The remaining sections of the thesis explore reconstruction techniques and applications of diffusion models to characterize human brain structures.

In present scenario image segmentation is used to extract abnormal tissues from normal tissues clearly in medical images. Tumor detection through brain MRI using automatic system is effective and consumes lesser time which helps doctor in diagnosis. A Tumor can convert into cancer, which is major leading cause of death. Automation of tumor detection is required for detecting tumor on early stage. Proposed work presents hybrid technique for information retrieval from brain MRI images.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful visualization tool that permits to acquire images of internal anatomy of human body in a secure and non-invasive manner. Automatic brain tumor detection from MRI images has become one of the major areas of medical research. The important task in the diagnosis of brain tumor is to determine the exact location, orientation and area of the abnormal tissues. This paper discuss the performance analysis of image segmentation techniques, viz., K-Means Clustering, Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Region Growing for detection of brain tumor from sample MRI images of brain. The performance evaluation of the above mentioned techniques is done on the basis of error percentage as compared to ground truth.

Cells were labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and injected into the circulation of mice. Individual cells trapped within the microcirculation of the brain could be visualized with high‐resolution MRI using optimized MR hardware and the fast imaging employing steady state acquisition (FIESTA) pulse sequence on a 1.5 T clinical MRI scanner. Single cells appear as discrete signal voids on MR images. Direct optical validation was provided by coregistering signal voids on MRI with single cells visualized using high‐resolution confocal microscopy. This work demonstrates the sensitivity of MRI for detecting single cells in small animals for a wide range of application from stem cell to cancer cell tracking.

metastases from breast cancer: FLT-PET imaging as a predictor of response","paperAbstract":"Background: The novel drug conjugate ANG1005 consists of 3 molecules of paclitaxel covalently linked to Angiopep-2. After binding to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, ANG1005 crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) by endocytosis. A multi-center Phase II study, with the primary endpoint of intracranial response in patients with breast cancer brain metastases is in progress. At the NCI, a biomarker substudy is evaluating 18F-FLT (39-Fluoro-39 deoxythymidine)-PET for response assessment. Methods: Patients with measurable brain metastases from breast cancer received ANG1005 at a dose of 550mg/m2 IV once every 21 days. Before and after cycle 1, all patients on study underwent imaging with 18F-FLT, a thymidine analog and novel imaging agent; retention of 18F-FLT correlating with DNA synthesis. In order to detect brain metastases and assess response to treatment, we compared FLT PET images with MRI-gadolinium contrast scans, obtaining both dynamic and static images. We determined the percentage (%) change after treatment with ANG1005; a decrease in ≥20% was considered significant. Results: Ten patients were enrolled on study. A total of 32 target and 20 non target CNS lesions in 10 patients were imaged and analyzed by MRI and FLT-PET. At 30 minutes, SUVmax ranged from 0.8 to 6.3 at baseline (mean 2.64), and the SUV80%, (mean of top 20% SUV units) ranged from 0.7 to 5.12. The median% change from baseline to post one cycle of ANG1005 was -19.9% for SUVmax (range +85.4 to -67.7, and was median -20.2% for SUV80% (range 95.7 to -69%). Two patients had confirmed partial responses lasting 6 and 18 cycles, respectively. Six patients had stable disease and received a median of 6 cycles. Tumor reductions, as determined by MRI per CNS RECIST version 1.1 ranged from -5% to -60% in lesion size, compared to baseline. Both FLT-PET parameters correlated with the% change in MRI measurements in the target lesions (R2 = 0.64, P = 0.0002). Conclusion: The development of CNS-directed therapies designed to cross the BBB, such as the paclitaxel conjugate ANG1005, is a research priority. As contrast-enhanced MRI detection of brain metastases is representative of gadolinium leakage through the BBB, as opposed to actual tumor volume, better approaches are needed to evaluate drug efficacy. Pilot evaluations of FLT-PET imaging in this setting suggest that it is a promising tool that may serve as a complementary assessment method for breast cancer brain metastases going forward.

A tumor is the abnormal growth of cells in human brain. Such abnormal cell growth may cause a cancer in the human brain which according to a recent survey has been one of the most rapidly increasing reasons of deaths. With such an alarming number of cancer patients due to brain tumor, it is important to automate the diagnosis process for accurate and fast detection of tumors in the MRI scan of the patients. This research work thus discusses in detail the different automated segmentation techniques for detection and segmentation of tumor in MR images of brain. A brain tumor dataset of Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL) and Department of Neurosurgery (NSG) is used which contains MRI brain tumor images of ten patients. The purpose of this research work is to compare different segmentation technique like threshold segmentation, histogram, watershed segmentation and k-means clustering and to find strategy which gives most accurate results. Segmentation techniques followed by morphological operations with optimum disk size of structuring element is used. The accuracy of Watershed technique using our segmentation strategy is 99.86% which is best of all other selected segmentation algorithms.","authors":[{"name":"A.

In recent years there is a rise in the death rate of patients suffering from brain cancer and lung cancer. The chances of survival among people can increase if the detection is done in the earlier stage. The widely used diagnose technique is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) Images which are used to present the cancer location in the brain and lungs. In this work the brain tumour and lung cancer is detected and registered through the medical images in three stages. First is the pre -processing stage, a set of medical images is filtered for removing noise by Gaussian filter, Secondly the image is segmented automatically using Otsu and KNN clustering. Edge Detection method is done by using canny detection method. Third stage is the feature extraction stage, in this stage the segmented MRI and CT images are registered to obtain the tumour. The feature detection methods used are the SIFT and SURF algorithm for both brain and lung images to obtain effective results. The SIFT and Affine Transform registration technique used increases the speed and reduces the complexity of geometrical alignments of two images that is the reference and sensed images. It also displays the minute difference between two identical images rapidly and accurately which is essential for medical diagnoses.","authors":[{"name":"Hemamalini  Bhanage","ids":["113813343"]},{"name":"J  Prakash","ids":["49173822"]}],"inCitations":["d60ebd56e4d55435c2a0b96d84bbcc8ea7e2de26","fc4163fb9822b4085aac5605b60d44cbb913561e","adb248738032fe85112e67727511b76c0e5d84ca","010eef9a6274a81e6b7f978a0e59739602354aef","5b13aef6405b1ee80e16b7a73aa6c39c750a2937"],"outCitations":["feac3cc15748f20e57c85b3b35ca7db7e17a9152","2aa555b0bc87da6e807509b54686e1c0c318ad34","a0696edf958a927e9676393ac4f7f867668ef12e","4721eb97534dcb830ca4042786b77402253d4fa8","a3872ebf074d93bbcf323cd9b29e518bd85cb4d1","19b33dba44e29c308f800aac5f6e4b558af3a7f4","33c756bfc599056771d587830cba7096c1954dea","0ceae4a97676d53e2944da7caf9ad900756f306b","5d72888f0a465c19292caedb65d65bd4bb3f97aa","8c04e0fe619a72e2735050a450fd7501e9dbb80b","bd47b1f3e2839af705187de7fe7d51a514997765","24392fbc86c5fbde6ff9114f733091ca5be24891"],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f3e1da36b52490bcf0ab2f8b2d06355d0e5fcab7","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"International journal of engineering and technology","journalVolume":"8","journalPages":"2234-2241","doi":"10.21817/IJET/2016/V8I5/160805205","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21817/IJET%2F2016%2FV8I5%2F160805205","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2548468273","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"66b99d07477cca28c16b66a3107813735b866905","title":"A Novel Two-Stage Approach For Automatic Detection of Brain Tumor","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor is one of the most life-threatening diseases, and it is the most common type of cancer that occurs among those in the age group belonging to 0-19. It is also a major cause of cancer-related deaths in children (males and females) under age 20 hence its detection should be fast and accurate. Manual detection of brain tumors using MRI scan images is effective but time-consuming. Many automation techniques and algorithms for detection of brain tumors are being proposed recently. In this paper, we propose an integrated two-step approach combining modified K-means clustering algorithm and Hierarchical Centroid Shape Descriptor (HCSD). The images are clustered using modified K-means based on pixel intensity, and then HCSD helps to select those having a specific shape thus making this approach more effective and reliable. Simulation of the proposed work is done in MATLAB R2013a. Tests are carried out on T1 weighted MRI scan images.","authors":[{"name":"A.  Murthi","ids":["145906309"]},{"name":"S.

We propose a novel out-of-atlas technique to estimate the spatial extent of abnormal brain regions by combining multi-atlas based segmentation with semi-local non-parametric intensity analysis. In a study with 30 clinically-acquired MRI scans of patients with malignant gliomas and 29 atlases of normal anatomy from research acquisitions, we demonstrate that this technique robustly identifies cancerous regions. The resulting segmentations could be used to study cancer morphometrics or guide selection/application/refinement of tumor analysis models or regional image quantification approaches.","authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

In this work, we propose a global framework using convolutional neural networks to create an intelligent assistant system for neurologists to diagnose the brain gliomas. Within this framework, we study the performance of different neural networks on four MRI modalities. This work allows us to highlight the most specific MRI sequences so that the presence of gliomas in brain tissue can be classified. We also visually analyze extracted features from the different modalities and networks with an aim to improve the interpretability and analysis of the performance obtained.

Furthermore, the four angles 0, 45, 90 and 135 are calculated the segmented brain image in GLCM. The four angular directions are calculated using texture features are correlation, energy, contrast and homogeneity. The texture analysis is performed a different types of images using past years. So the algorithm proposed statistical texture features are calculated for iterative image segmentation. These results show that MRI image can be implemented in a system of brain cancer detection.","authors":[{"name":"Kavitha  Prithiviraj","ids":["150177021"]},{"name":"S  Prabakaran","ids":["144710156"]}],"inCitations":["0cfdb9f1829dc17590db173f6b5b2d6d088196cb","e3d6812c51f33cf4b6ba301641abff42ffd1f707","a9f7302f1cf13f40ca17e8a69a383a8103ccb337","29ec8bb61db77094eab19d8b28ea1890cb56b95b","6471477119b5312ad55bfb3e0f54ff817daa3614","a9f5c91973d0d0b61d3b201713b26a899261033e","f31b327198b603ce4adfcbf258b683018b7dcf0e","ead9d6296c7d4f56983c76b5f7e880b7a8b2d385","9a6905448b86c78d4a44d633daad5f4897661a41","a3d6651d0771765f49bcb5c1bc5e084de06c763f","a2e5578087a70162b95cc6c069594776fc8c95c6","bcfa410691ca3fff7674159126514c4c3e4b636c","226e739d382d29f3a8b46446aa40fad9d2e74255","0d451cec99758961c0f47aaf3b6689577022d6bc","b13c799e2d4745587cc113ed852cc2a59a45d1b8","0ac40711998222100d08a32a528acfa853ccb72b","4e7fc32db155957d10e11339a231dfe290f59e20","c0c30db2aff66b7ceb9097f7fbafbce094410984","ae6d08314a4433b0fd4ca627a90d064d4d0ad2da","7ec3f4df21c1470142eab7d93b8b3355db6d3856","f0cc7e90f3a57b7975a2c5c6ff95ea6ff6228d2a","05c455bd7208779cbe2c0a1cb913a11e95e78f46","9227c039d07475711629af633348bb3a658ca42f","af323b788266b47fe6fd9eb9b9e4ebbdae104fbf","c0574e7d6b4b9c116d48600ced91c463656ca4aa","26640fb6f7a0d5b0c6616e3e8e1497726926befc","337821ec738adcec36a9b1e64ea8b5ae522471d2","c6d730adece36c55f5863dc8bd92cce3b323f521","067fe8f45ea68a4ead94a7ac9c51ba3a9c0473ab","142fa94778f73cc3f666265aae9b9e9345fd503c","35932ded72fb6f164ecde8c8cee724f82307ba5d","c189e200ccf49bddcba58588f218a9b5ce8a03cd","8c8e99db4f87e707d05078fbd56f8768eab8e5f4","14ba95ae8c53c42894536e52e64cf85848cb4ae3","c2e84b54ad0e6421b93b2e6cc9bb707f4ed648b0","af6f6623d9c76b1fbb510edd5463bd5aff8eb78f","1861ed7faac038aed9d04e3dc65d7cc973a142cb","65904283a5b94a7af8c55ddc8e42d6ab1dc776a6","165e15594d1f17d84211001dbb365798e4d9175f","bc3300e1a029e37f5031b03a2334eae0f99a8171","272f82f47138c8ff7137a50fc31035e7ce8f6129","b47cce141ab0c74fc43378322b7ede185cea669c","fe8f8b925bc4519810a6fcea98e6607b17df6947","4fc15db05db7c1cc06ef1077a1966974e544d716","445f2692f8ec15dd6b8eca8c9d603bc1fddc7cec","d796be7deb1fba3aa0d455ede1e0fae25c6c07b9","e279d571e054a83f80a52d5c3e19a227e11e3c9a","717220744d2e5e2306146e119a053e67e83675cb","7bc090e444856b5ffd9f52d931f7f9762355dddd","f95c04847ca75a91bfca8476180e52c8d09a5209","d04b77edff98c6d7b7d221824e25f9e5275ba3c1","cd278df729b83a8a958ab882c1eddf3e6b49d569","281a8fdb69f4bc0d1ba556c607e4ad7926d5d6e1"],"outCitations":["fc357576d73b855cbbe688bc402c1c030aa8d8da"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0603243d92c70adfec3294a91ef19942ec60804f","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201906.0166/v1/download"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"10.20944/PREPRINTS201906.0166.V1","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.20944/PREPRINTS201906.0166.V1","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2949583084","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a9279103740d15dfcc501f3184f158f097969762","title":"New horizons in bioelectromagnetics and bioimaging","paperAbstract":"Bioelectromagnetics is an interdisciplinary field where electromagnetics, biology and medicine overlap.

Existing skull-stripping methods have primarily targeted non-pathologicallyaffected brains. Accordingly, they may perform suboptimally when applied on brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans that have clearly discernible pathologies, such as brain tumors. Furthermore, existing methods focus on using only T1-weighted MRI scans, even though multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans are routinely acquired for patients with suspected brain tumors. Here we present a performance evaluation of publicly available implementations of established 3D Deep Learning architectures for semantic segmentation (namely DeepMedic, 3D U-Net, FCN), with a particular focus on identifying a skull-stripping approach that performs well on brain tumor scans, and also has a low computational footprint. We have identified a retrospective dataset of 1,796 mpMRI brain tumor scans, with corresponding manually-inspected and verified gold-standard brain tissue segmentations, acquired during standard clinical practice under varying acquisition protocols at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Our quantitative evaluation identified DeepMedic as the best performing method (Dice = 97.9, Hausdorf f 95 = 2.68). We release this pre-trained model through the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk) platform.","authors":[{"name":"Siddhesh P.

Doctors suggest numerous scans like CT, MRI, PET, and SPECT for estimating the type of cancer, size and location of the tumor and the aging or spread of cancer. A single imaging technique is not sufficient for correct diagnosis of the disease. In case the scans are ambiguous, it can lead doctors to incorrect diagnosis, which can be unsafe to the patient. The solution to this problem is fusing images from different scans containing complementary information to generate accurate images with minimum uncertainty. There are many ways of fusing images; the techniques considered in this paper are based on Multiscale transforms and Sparse Representation. By using, these 2 techniques a novel image fusion algorithm is proposed. NSCT and NSCT-SR are implemented and results are reported on 12 pairs of CT and MRI images. The experimental results show superior performance in terms of contrast, PSNR, UIQI and SSIM for the proposed technique.","authors":[{"name":"Leena  Chandrashekar","ids":["35147554"]}],"inCitations":["6e8f3bddf7b43b2c568abc835d5e073eea6e85d1"],"outCitations":[],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e916c806b890b0fc549f736826ddb1852aa35e7f","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"5","journalPages":"12-21","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2909161793","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a3e039ebc8d7e4fcc40a9d9eec8636fc100ab4e5","title":"Genetic Algorithm Based Fuzzy Local Informationc-Means (Gaflicm) Clustering Algorithm And Hybrid Kernel Convolution Neural Network (Hkcnn) With Distributed Processing Framework For Brain Mri Images","paperAbstract":"Cancer is the large important origin of casualty in today world. Among many cancers, brain cancer has been becomes one of the lowest living rate. It is formed based on the brain tumor. However brain tumors are able to have diverse categories based on their shape, texture, and position. Appropriate identification and retrieval of the tumor types create potential the doctor to compose the right cure option and assist keep the patient's life. Image processing has gained wide attention in medical analysis and health in recently. In general image processing methods, brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image collections cannot be processed efficiently on one computer due to large collection sizes and high computational costs. Hence, parallel computing and distributed system has been performed increasingly for brain MRI images in recently.  In this paper, a novel Medical Image Cloud Processing (MICP) based distributed processing framework is proposed for brain MRI images by lesser computational time. In this work, image preprocessing is done by using the Adaptive Median Filtering (AMF) and image enhancement by Histogram Equalization (HE). The proposed MICP framework includes of Static Medical Image Cloud Processing (SMICP) and Dynamic Medical Image Cloud Processing (DMICP). In MICP framework, SMICP consists of two methods called Pure-Image and Big-Image. These methods are integrated to Genetic Algorithm based Fuzzy Local Information C-Means-MapReduce (GAFLICM-MR) algorithm to attain more optimized design and higher effectiveness. The core design of GAFLICM-MR framework is to make use of the rich computing resources given by means of the distributed system consequently as to apply efficient parallel processing. GAFLICM algorithm is also used as brain tumor segmentation in MRI images. In MICP framework, DMICP is developed via a parallel processing process of the distributed system. For retrieval and detection of brain Magnetic MRIimages into normal and tumor, Hybrid Kernel Convolution Neural Network (HKCNN) is developed in this work. Finally the results of the HKCNN classifier are compared to other previous works like precision, recall, f-measure, accuracy, time and memory.","authors":[{"name":"K  Vigneshwari","ids":["1644052035"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["405aed4b8ecdd869b2e83095dde51c396334115f","5c80ae72b11197614ca2460fc30c1115dd2d6481","e83975aa3935ecdc79a7f27143a6080cbfb8bba0","c73d4a2046466e79cf92637ae6858e9daa1f1dd9","dbbfd69e72bb7b7d1744fa494836bf44f851ad71","1366de5bb112746a555e9c0cd00de3ad8628aea8","26cb14c9d22cf946314d685fe3541ef9f641e429","9e7ce336c8fea4b87bf68f83a23e262c58310cea","b8504d447d358f48bc9e6b2d32314809794889c1","6c14d71b84034af6bba3298cf3c3ee2d133f2094","89f33810a5b1dae6c63b3d994c483c95ec4b6312","9cf12985c1c1ba99e946fa1f21c4fbaedd1e58e5","4f8d648c52edf74e41b0996128aa536e13cc7e82","bf4ec0da2cc152b99a3c7fdd4849a977d6976bdf","b9c3631120c171570b94f946273b98c32505fc9a","7da5c56244847c9c16f9e68915bbe52486a620b4","252a28ba356a5e3c63bbed69297c12ca2dab45da","3813b88a4ec3c63919df47e9694b577f4691f7e5","97c3efeaa7ddcc4e6130d5502ff4a088b6ff544d","adef477b7d08899d25e314f3e97253fbbb7ac4da","49c5f7b313eb4d7b4442074b9807200ac6aadda5","5234c02d585d1c55222af089825d59ea81e7202a","4417f78b31546227784941bbd6f6532a177e60b8","40992099a194695d9eee2e6d2e7bdf4d4dcaa7dd","16222d2f1e19dc0687f8477ad373a170fba48565","83e9565cede81b2b88a9fa241833135da142f4d3","a538b05ebb01a40323997629e171c91aa28b8e2f","304a76d159d7d8a4ab5e5c982682d7bc58cec3c6","a205364f79c3208e9ede8bdf55f1b93e36d96a43","9c95e5baf66e5f01427aafe820d1fe5a2f0c82a1","2bd429dc00a52be425ec74306c5547a63bad8f32","54d48a42a34f368240b79e7c98c7d9283f79b350","282078d456d056eacb9a7f67994e0e7d88e04b14","9a0d455b8723f8e358e132f64e3b782304afc64d","d02c02713ef78a3c46873cfafd866d937fddb6f3","2e72c8aa2acf362ab98667a2e2c49f6b52b656ee","4fb437995a4c196b382f39e4c17de4a402be3274","b1a5961609c623fc816aaa77565ba38b25531a8e","39ea5cdda15e571acb86b9e7144bd8dbabb3f1db","8b64a942b5b1d07473e9a391f029b69b93e331a5"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a3e039ebc8d7e4fcc40a9d9eec8636fc100ab4e5","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://turcomat.org/index.php/turkbilmat/article/download/5375/4482/9968"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"12","journalPages":"5639-5656","doi":"10.17762/TURCOMAT.V12I10.5375","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17762/TURCOMAT.V12I10.5375","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3159525086","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"5f44e4a580827d659898bcfbea2e64dcb470caad","title":"A Simple Approach to Automated Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor is the abnormal growth of superfluous cells in central nervous system or brain. It is fact that brain tumor is second most common of cancer death among young people. There are two key categories of brain tumor as cancerous and non cancerous. The cancerous brain tumor is called as Malignant. It spreads very quickly and difficult to remove. The non-cancerous tumor, called Benign, growth rate is very slow as compared to malignant one and easy to remove. The work proposes a simple but more efficient method to detect and segment the brain tumor from the MRI image. The proposed work based on the threshold segmentation for the segmentation of the brain tumor. The MRI image of the brain is taken and processed in such a way so that the tumor is extracted from the given MRI image and displays the segmented part of the image which contains the tumor. The otsu global threshold performs tumor segmentation and image area opening applies to remove the small components form the tumor portion. The gray level co-occurrence matrix and other image quality measures computes (extracts) the features from the segmented image. Support vector machine classifier is finally classifies the tumor, either benign or malignant, based on the extracted features.","authors":[{"name":"P  Ganesan","ids":["2147560"]},{"name":"B. S.

Health experts have increasingly taken advantage of the benefits of these technologies thus generating a scalable improvement in the area of health care. Because of this, there is paradigm shift from manual monitoring toward more accurate virtual monitoring with minimum percentage of error in the area of health care. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) led to exciting solutions with good accuracy for medical imaging and is a key method for future applications in health care. Brain tumor detection is an important task in medical image processing. Early detection of brain tumors plays an important role in improving treatment possibilities and thus increasing the survival rate of the patients. Manual detection of the brain tumors for cancer diagnosis from a large amount of MRI images generated in clinical routines is a difficult and time consuming task due to the complexity and variance of tumors and medical data. So, there is a need for automatic brain tumor detection from brain MRI images. With the help of deep learning networks, we can automate the detection process. For that, we have proposed a new network known as BrainNET which reads the MRI images coming from the MRI machine, and then, it detects as well as classifies the brain tumor if present.","authors":[{"name":"Aditya  Raj","ids":["2084541996"]},{"name":"Abhishek  Anil","ids":["82683237"]},{"name":"P.

The commonest malignant brain tumor is a Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with less than 5% 5-year survival. Low skeletal muscle mass is associated with poor survival in cancer and is measurable on routine imaging, but manual muscle mass quantification is time-consuming and susceptible to interrater inconsistency. In patients with brain tumors, measurement of the thickness of the temporalis muscle acts as a proxy. We present a fully-automated deep learning-based system for temporalis muscle quantification, a skeletal muscle mass surrogate on MRI head. Methods: MRI scans of 330 patients were obtained from four different datasets. Two 2D U-Nets were trained, one to segment the eyeballs and the other to segment the temporalis muscle, and used to quantify the cross-sectional area of the eyeballs and temporalis muscle. The eyeball segmentation was used to chose a consistent level on which to assess temporalis muscle mass. We assessed accuracy of segmentation using DICE and Hausdorff scores, and assessed the performance of the system to choose the correct slice on the MRI by comparing it with a manual choice of MRI slice. Results: The set models predict eyeball and temporalis muscle segmentations with good accuracy. Mean Dice scores is $0.90\\pm 0.03$ and $0.90\\pm 0.05$ and Hausdorff distances are $2.88\\pm 0.60$ and $1.89\\pm 0.35$, respectively. The automatic pipeline chooses slices for segmentation that are either identical or close to the manual choice in 96.1% of cases. Conclusions: We have developed an end-to-end system that uses two independently trained U-Nets to first segment the eyeball and then use that as a reference point to pick the correct slice of the MRI on which to use the second U-Net to measure temporalis cross-sectional area. This allows for the automated processing of head MRI scans to measure temporalis muscle mass, which has been previously shown to correlate with body muscle mass and survival in several cancer types.","authors":[{"name":"Radvile  Mauricaite","ids":["2120069060"]},{"name":"Ella  Mi","ids":["82302402"]},{"name":"Jiarong  Chen","ids":["2109324296"]},{"name":"Andrew  Ho","ids":["2053349161"]},{"name":"Lillie  Pakzad-Shahabi","ids":["1659056392"]},{"name":"Matt  Williams","ids":[]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a6af3adb042ca0bcbd304f2ec7d61a2d97042c08","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMS52027.2021.00095"],"venue":"2021 IEEE 34th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","journalName":"2021 IEEE 34th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"107-112","doi":"10.1109/CBMS52027.2021.00095","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMS52027.2021.00095","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"035bb4fe097afcdbe70b6ef214fd03f155e196fe","title":"MR compatible positioning device for guiding a focused ultrasound system for the treatment of brain deseases","paperAbstract":"A prototype magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐compatible positioning device that navigates a high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer is presented.

The early and correct diagnosis of brain tumors plays an important role. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique is the most popular non-invasive technique; in these days imaging of biological structures by MRI is a common investigating procedure. For cancer diagnosis the brain tumors segmentation can be done manually from MRI, which gives the poor level of accuracy and identification. The classification of abnormalities is not predictable and straightforward but it is a time consuming task for physician. Nowadays, the issue of automatic segmentation and analysis of brain tumours are major research area. However the detection of tumor is a challenging task since tumor possesses complex characteristics in appearance and boundaries. In order to produce a completely automated segmentation method like the KG (knowledge-guided) technique which encrypts the information of the pixel intensity and spatial relationships in the images. The k NN classifier under the learned optimal distance metrics is used to determine the possibility of each pixel belonging to the foreground (tumour) and the back ground. The paper presents semi-automatic segmentation method by using CNN (Convolutional neural networks) on the basis of individual statistical information and population, to segment brain tumours early, increase the correct rate and minimize error rate.

There has been advances in glioma research and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most accurate non-invasive medical tool to localize and analyse brain cancer. The scientific global community has been organizing challenges of open data analysis to push forward automatic algorithms to tackle this task. In this paper we analyse part of such challenge data, the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS), with novel algorithms using partial learning to test an active learning methodology and tensor-based image modelling methods to deal with the fusion of the multimodal MRI data into one space. A Random Forest classifier is used for pixel classification. Our results show an error rates of 0.011 up to 0.057 for intra-subject classification. These results are promising compared to other studies. We plan to extend this method to use more than 3 MRI modalities and present a full active learning approach.","authors":[{"name":"K.

Medical image processing has dramatically revolutionized the health care sector by helping radiologists toward an early and accurate diagnosis of the tumors. A brain tumor is an abnormal lump of tissues in which body cells grow and proliferate uncontrollably manner. In the world, the brain tumor is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the age group of 20–45 and fifth leading cause among women. So, the detection of the tumor is a very important part of its treatment.

A brain tumour is an abnormal mass of tissues in which cells grow and multiply uncontrollably, seemingly unchecked by the mechanisms that control normal cells. A brain tumour is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and the fifth leading cause among women. Diagnosis of the tumour at earlier stage is a very important part of its treatment. For detecting the brain tumour MRI and CT scan are the most significant techniques. Despite promising techniques like MRI, CT scan, characterisation of abnormalities is still a challenging and difficult task. This paper presented an automated computer-aided brain tumour detection system which first classifies the tumourous from non-tumourous MRI images and then calculates the area of the affected region using hysteresis thresholding technique which segments the lesion region from other part, feature extraction using Gabor filters and then SVM classifier for classification. The pursuance of the suggested system is evaluated in term of sensitivity, specificity, classification accuracy and area under curve (AUC) using ground truth images. The proposed system gives an average accuracy of 97%.","authors":[{"name":"Nitish","ids":["116865134"]},{"name":"Amit Kumar Singh","ids":["152395050"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cdd74ec129079a03a8e16b098f96b348b26704b8","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems Technologies and Applications","journalVolume":"19","journalPages":"526-540","doi":"10.1504/ijista.2020.10034666","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/ijista.2020.10034666","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3120492750","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"178adf0ef2e886e11fe365fd0598e346fa9f0c9c","title":"AUTOMATIC DETECTION AND SEVERITY ANALYSIS OF BRAIN TUMORS USING GUI IN MATLAB","paperAbstract":"Medical image processing is the most challenging an d emerging field now a day’s processing of MRI imag es is one of the parts of this field.

Thus, nanostructured MgO was synthesized from a coprecipitation technique involving twin synthetic protocols and the resulting product was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), size distribution histogram, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and elemental composition was confirmed by EDX analysis. They were tested for selective antigen response in a human brain cancer model through biodistribution, biotoxicity via MTT assay, and tissue morphology. In addition, the MRI compatibility of MgO nanostructures and immunofluorescence studies were investigated on nanoconjugates with different immunoglobulins in the brain section. The results indicated that MgO had some degree of bindings with the antigens. These results led to the empirical modeling of MgO nanomaterials towards toxicity in cancer cells by analyzing the statistical data obtained by experiments.

This tumor, when turns in to cancer become life-threatening. So medical imaging, it is necessary to detect the exact location of tumor and its type. For locating tumor in magnetic resonance image (MRI), segmentation of MRI plays an important role. A variety of algorithms were developed for segmentation of MRI images by using different tools and methods. Mechanizing this process is a tricky task because of the high diversity in the appearance of tumor tissues among different patients and in many cases similarity with the usual tissues. Physical segmentation of medical image by the radiologist is a monotonous and prolonged process. MRI is a highly developed medical imaging method providing rich information about the person soft-tissue structure. This paper includes survey on different segmentation techniques applied to MR Images for locating tumor.","authors":[{"name":"Ann Christeen Saji","ids":["150029340"]},{"name":"Annmary  Paul","ids":["150025937"]},{"name":"Ansha  Sankar","ids":["150030355"]}],"inCitations":["b607efcae6e570de5f570916f317fc99bc792893","2081229558204142e5448ad89030c9f734b48475"],"outCitations":[],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/586a908975293d20b9d92a5cf6e90f482e915be3","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"Journal of emerging technologies and innovative research","journalVolume":"3","journalPages":"150-151-150-151","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2801879574","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"d5d17ec784bdf8c232cce0a492d471793989c829","title":"A novel feature extraction approach for tumour detection and classification of data based on hybrid SP classifier","paperAbstract":"This paper deals with identifying the cancer affected region of the brain. Many tools and techniques such as self-organising map (SOM), Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) classifiers etc. exist to find out the cancer affected region in the brain. But the rapid growth in brain tumour cases in recent past indicates that the existing technologies have failed to identify its root cause as identification is a complex process and recent studies also reveal that different types of brain tumours can be treated either through surgery or in rare cases, with radiation. Image segmentation helps in identifying brain tumours, by calculating the volume and the growth of the tumours using techniques like human edge correction, outer edge colouring and interactive threshold holdings. In order to reduce the human error and to get the accurate results in MRI images there is an urgent need to find out an automatic or semi-automatic method for the classification of brain tumour images. The paper presents a 'hybrid SP' classifier and discusses its results in the detection and classification of brain cancer.","authors":[{"name":"Nanda Gopal Reddy","ids":["120690068"]},{"name":"Roheet  Bhatnagar","ids":["49566832"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d5d17ec784bdf8c232cce0a492d471793989c829","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Reasoning-based Intelligent Systems","journalVolume":"10","journalPages":"252-257","doi":"10.1504/IJRIS.2018.10017502","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/IJRIS.2018.10017502","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2900486477","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"b607ece1c0cb2930b663401b25906db09f6b2763","title":"Magnetic resonance imaging of metastases in xenograft mouse models of cancer.","paperAbstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of small animals has emerged as a valuable tool to noninvasively monitor tumor growth in mouse models of cancer. However, imaging of metastases in mouse models is difficult due to the need for high spatial resolution. We have demonstrated MRI of metastases in the liver, brain, adrenal glands, and lymph nodes in different xenograft mouse models of cancer. MRI of mice was performed with a clinical 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner and a commercially available small-animal receiver coil. The imaging protocol consisted of T1- and T2-weighted fat-saturated spin echo sequences with a spatial resolution of 200 μm × 200 μm × 500 μm. Total acquisition time was 30 min per mouse. The technique allowed for repetitive examinations of larger animal cohorts to observe the development of metastases.","authors":[{"name":"Kersten  Peldschus","ids":["4868386"]},{"name":"Harald  Ittrich","ids":["3382983"]}],"inCitations":["037255de787d071b48421e9fc3c9abec113b0b0c","3062ad970313dfc3eddac5500f5120b6b5a99905","b83f3487c4e66592b9145c881a115799b954bdcd","7093549ac6672cc7b6652969bb2deeb168cd7d6a","f31032ca49621042a06e1800e2614c21b458a3f2","32c3042d0c97ee63227abbd8e32838f8134b60c5","594e5db00f491c9a0177bb67ec86d782c7717fdb"],"outCitations":["c874ec26a14d134ab47dd4b40b24482994dc0bbe","3f8f7e32558b0d1f8e17e5498281dcdff5503fe8","3bcc265a3973557430aba81dad9a779a5e372c28","4af8b8aa91b96a58c85262700104f36acbeba27d","3661413488d93476796da92ac1102dec90dfbe15","60ed04721286804dfb3845ed77632ab593f12d58","6caf20a7b005d13ea5611624a90c421de2418615","5fe76db61ed38207b8f6713ba81081420b274612","1db265c57a28506c28d1ac4b8b352e4d3b22175a","5600665a1ffbdded0c2aaf074db3d2baf03c8e45","b212e8dc41a3a9283edb88c5135b8b1e40b78c34","0481eddf0192dd0bf645d65ec78ab6942f93aee1","10869a7b5a9563caf93d1d2ae967b3f981ad0eaf","2a26a08fca7a35f6ab20609e44b586e91d0864f5","52f78fcba056ded58b97067fa81a84f4f7b3e5e1","eba9bdfbc7d86e6f7d43b171ed9057374e3e8f08","73ef6f063e86071da74e1dc7a5df2415badca332","4d6c351545f037e5d0780c915b8e4abaec565013","b7d29311b4690502ebabb0079c6f281605d0c5d2","08f664d7f3deca229702f501056062d56d8a1ce7"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b607ece1c0cb2930b663401b25906db09f6b2763","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Methods in molecular biology","journalName":"Methods in molecular biology","journalVolume":"1070","journalPages":"\n          213-22\n        ","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4614-8244-4_16","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-8244-4_16","pmid":"24092443","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2398593959","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"63586cd9e5171a17aec185506e33ef5dbcb074b1","title":"Robust Classification of Multi Class Brain Tumor in MRI Images using Hybrid Structure Descriptor and Fuzzy based Kernel-SVM","paperAbstract":"Tumor is a cluster of anomalous cells growing up in the brain.

It consist of identification of different types of tumor tissues from normal brain MRI images. Recently, pathway CNNs have been used for semantic segmentation, however are computationally expensive. Build upon success of SegNet, in this paper, we presented different architectures of SegNeT encoder and decoder based on pixel-wise classification. Nonlinear up sampling are performed by the model. The end to end training and small number of parameters used for the training makes the computational process more higher than other deep learning architectures. We performed the semantic segmentation on the MRI brain tumor Figshare dataset and achieved the state of the arts results (99.93% global accuracy) in comparison to traditional CNN models.","authors":[{"name":"Arshia  Rehman","ids":["51297011"]},{"name":"Saeeda  Naz","ids":["2776683"]},{"name":"Usman  Naseem","ids":["1394609613"]},{"name":"Imran  Razzak","ids":["1630421985"]},{"name":"Ibrahim A.

In a similar way, MRI could be the cutting edge regenerative imaging technology, which permits an angle sectional perspective of the body, which gives convenience to specialists to inspect the affected person. In this study, the authors had attempted the strategy to classify MRI images (4-Dimensional) either at the beginning of production to have a tumor or even can be utilized for tumor recognition. The aim of the study is to address the aforementioned problems associated with the brain cancer due to the leakage of CSF. Methods/Findings: This research is to construct the research framework that can identify cancer damage area or be isolated from tumors and non-tumors quiet by using Fourier transformation. Another research tool, based on Fourier Transform, is the main mathematical method for frequency analysis and has extensive engineering and science applications. Because DFT is omnipresent, there has been extensive study of highways for the DFT account and active research has continued. Application: Several fast algorithms are provided by the DFT partitioning method. In this document, we provide DFT with two rapid implementation algorithms to assess their performance. This study helps the detection of brain cancer due to the process of interfacing the 4-D (4 Dimensional) image segmentation process and Fourier transformation. 4-D is followed by MATLAB software modeling techniques to measure the size of brain damage cells deep inside of CSF. These Methods of light fields can be useful for improving the quality of application editing segmentation and light field composite pipeline, as they reduce boundary artefacts. \nKeywords: Brain Tumor, Cerebrospinal Fluid, Fourier Transformation, Image segmentation, MRI","authors":[{"name":"Soobia  Saeed","ids":["73756290"]},{"name":"Afnizanfaizal  Abdullah","ids":["3103477"]},{"name":"Nz.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these tumors, but the large amount of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. Consequently, automatic and reliable segmentation methods are required. However, the large spatial and structural variability among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this contribution, we present a new model of segmentation of brain magnetic resonance images. In order to obtain the region of interest, we propose a hybrid approach that carries out both fuzzy c-mean algorithm and multiobjective optimization taking into account both compactness and separation in the clusters with the purpose of improving the cluster center detection and speed up the convergence time.

Primary surgical resection is one of the most effective ways of treating brain tumors and can have a tremendously increased success rate if the appropriate imaging modality is used for complete tumor resection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for brain tumor imaging because of its excellent soft-tissue contrast. MRI combined with continuum soft robotics has immense potential to be the next major technological breakthrough in the field of brain cancer diagnosis and therapy. In this paper, we present the design, kinematic, and force analysis of a flexible spring-based minimally invasive neurosurgical intracranial robot. It is comprised of an interconnected inner spring and an outer spring and is connected to actively cooled shape memory alloy (SMA) spring actuators via tendon driven mechanism. Our robot has three serially connected 2-DoF segments, which can be independently controlled due to the central tendon routing configuration. The kinematic and force analysis of the robot and the independent segment control were verified by experiments. Robot motion under forced cooling of SMA springs was evaluated as well as the MRI compatibility of the robot and its motion capability in brain-like gelatin environment.","authors":[{"name":"Yeongjin  Kim","ids":["2271379"]},{"name":"Shing Shin Cheng","ids":["21594385"]},{"name":"Mahamadou  Diakite","ids":["145267742"]},{"name":"Rao P.

For example the Tumor cells, cancer cells and the fractures in the different parts are examined but the accuracy is unpredictable. In this system, a Normalized cut segmentation techniques is used for segmenting medical brain images and then Region Classification algorithm is used in order to isolate the abnormal and normal regions in the medical brain images which is entirely independent and has the capability to separate various kinds of abnormalities. Finally, the abnormal stage is detected for each brain image by staging process.","authors":[{"name":"V.  Ulagamuthalvi","ids":["20557039"]},{"name":"G.

Early diagnosis is thus essential for treatment. The brain segmentation process is still challenging due to complexity and variation of the tumor structure, intensity similarity between tumor tissues and normal brain tissues. In this paper, a fully automated and reliable brain tumor segmentation system is proposed. This system is able to detect range of slices from a volume that is likely to contain tumor in MRI images. An iterated k-means algorithm is used for the segmentation process in conjunction with a cluster validity index to select the optimal number of clusters. The proposed approach is evaluated using simulated and real MRI of human brain from multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (BRATS) organized by MICCAI 2012 challenge. Our results achieved average for Dice overlap and Jaccard index for complete tumor region of 91.96% and 98.31% respectively when testing a set of 77 volumes. This shows the robustness of the new technique for clinical routine use.","authors":[{"name":"Engy N Eltayeb","ids":["114833143"]},{"name":"Nancy M Salem","ids":["40295484"]},{"name":"Walid  Al-Atabany","ids":["41035768"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["0be448f70869bd71497607200d3ccc991603d0c0","23045299013e8738bc8eff73827ef8de256aef66","f1483f1dd99c074348f042b3a5621a8924aa99c7","03d67da60612e60692b0bfdac1eedadc0a98905d","1f14b29b758c590f90ce1cce77d3152da25271ad","626738cd03143a6cfcd8ea834bef9e092bc702e0","dc169f30f62d57f3785090e33ef1875df5124ec5","2d1f484b00302dad635766ffc0711684f6fa4896","552ba88b8b170e6bfa65d003890eae780e77af44","6d6bc9a6454fe18fa772565614ace6e76b9a0057","33a57f1bdf313752aa518ce0fd333d89b244d76c","26850e2fd94d5839f09b9d715d9e0012cccaf5d3","5429bd2e98880ad677d2105efccd28549b910281","80b2dba230f924a319889cd9cf9411687efc45f7","5a9b93d6b3fef4dd85bf5821c5889aed8cfcc1e4","b1e83485b5c833a5e30e1d29abc723a3bb89252a","51256786adc028ced3bb1a727c1980f19ccdef98","4130e4e00b52f8947a671116f2fd029cce8cac79","4e607b44337fe7160cb4f4ce153332c7e53964a7","5bb9988389faadd30b6ee3deb170741f926a3136","4d2f0f119a6ecf15669636c8d261dbd9e0207447","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ec876d5051b50d04e2e6d022253e77296b5233e1","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Bio-medical materials and engineering","journalName":"Bio-medical materials and engineering","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"10.3233/BME-191066","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3233/BME-191066","pmid":"31476145","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2970489701","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"81a1f3b556853292ad692b4b82ff94d9e27f9d21","title":"Brain tumor detection based on segmentation using MATLAB","paperAbstract":"An unusual mass of tissue in which some cells multiplies and grows uncontrollably is called brain tumor. It starts growing inside the skull and interpose with the regular functioning of the brain. It needs to be detected at an early stage using MRI or CT scanned images when it is as small as possible because the tumor can possibly result to cancer [1]. This paper, mainly focuses on detecting and localizing the tumor region existing in the brain by proposed methodology using patient's MRI images. The proposed methodology consists of three stages i.e. pre-processing, edge detection and segmentation. Pre-processing stage involves converting original image into a grayscale image and removes noise if present or crept in. This is followed by edge detection using Sobel, Prewitt and Canny algorithms with image enhancement techniques. Next, segmentation is applied to clearly display the tumor affected region in the MRI images. Finally, the image is clustered using the k-means algorithm. Here we have used MATLAB for the development of the project.","authors":[{"name":"Animesh  Hazra","ids":["50846418"]},{"name":"Ankit  Dey","ids":["122638813"]},{"name":"Sujit Kumar Gupta","ids":["2116012232"]},{"name":"Md.

Out of all types of cancer, brain cancer has the lowest survival rate. Brain tumors can have different types depending on their shape, texture, and location. Proper diagnosis of the tumor type enables the doctor to make the correct treatment choice and help save the patient's life. There is a high need in the Artificial Intelligence field for a Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) system to assist doctors and radiologists with the diagnosis and classification of tumors. Over recent years, deep learning has shown an optimistic performance in computer vision systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach for classifying brain tumor types using Residual Networks. We evaluate the proposed model on a benchmark dataset containing 3064 MRI images of 3 brain tumor types (Meningiomas, Gliomas, and Pituitary tumors). We have achieved the highest accuracy of 99% outperforming the other previous work on the same dataset.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah Ali Abdelaziz Ismael","ids":["1491790476"]},{"name":"Ammar  Mohammed","ids":["2112710638"]},{"name":"Hesham A.

Nowadays, medical imaging techniques play an important role in cancer diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most used techniques to identify and locate the tumor in the brain. Images obtained by medical imaging techniques may become a better quality image thru applying image processing techniques. In this study, we aim to develop a method for clearly distinguishing the tissues affected by the cancer. The proposed approach is used to obtain a segmented tumor region clear enough to be observed by the medical practitioner and give them more detail about the tumor in their diagnosis. In the proposed approach, morphological operations, pixel subtraction, threshold based segmentation and image filtering techniques are used. The proposed approach is based on obtaining clear images of the skull, brain and the tumor. When compared, the proposed approach gave a better result than the other approach.","authors":[{"name":"Umit  Ilhan","ids":["2781760"]},{"name":"Ahmet  İlhan","ids":["145878719"]}],"inCitations":["9db37ae1ff06ccc58be20532c6a52427bd65d4ba","7e4cdb7ceccd10da7a51819097ee6c26bf32c1a6","0a39a9ec80c0f7245a8f7cbe4217bd22c65543ae","3b3141c287b202120d0dc9c36f40ec9420587145","cb6418dd20efab2dd7f74a145d540d1d17cf3b5d","40e63d6a7b8a70b7eeae3cf23e144681c6ef3d8b","172c443ef70038477c3b01d32fffb648abb24d69","1575f469735d4d18db0bc63d9989624a60236b2c","cdb4fd7c9ab4da08e05b6fc4517737bbffaf8856","d95a92dea119002448bbc9319baaaf0123e2df5f","8fa9e11917637bffc8c41a0eeecf80c5b125df8e","eb5ac1e732d75a6681d9d10b7407f1e00393cbdb","d2e3c14665eca5eb0082cfb41ac19ed3a09c0abc","1992f88bf688dce7e554d42cb21213fe60b0d416","e1ab35a6c4599ff09c3b45138fef8aab5d422b20","1cffeb0817828362916ab52b1ac064ccc7e1fcc8","e946a51630ec15c5e9cba7d360c231ec3b1db981","84602fd858e40d142569e194c7619c77de89ae14","47eaf826c335d72c35faa1a9c9812fc3efed0574","40cc4e114db23c81c98ff20cad6c6955052c1726","310d81c0872920062e0761920d2a7b4f8613d6ba","b8952f3fb76374547c29453fd0416949aae372cc","9c57e1e0a93c8f0572e38bca8051149649e3593c","65cb18f900713ac95607e9ccb1008933822e1b48","67bdfa2877056d827b4031d60170e427b2df6e13","ac764ef057625e5b96f2da51cda08535b99597f0","a57d902b426780e23f5d1a540277298a31f42611","d756a31318baf6ad5464c4ab465cc5b2f7325449","677e069843552c74c927a302825d76992de38ffd","6e7d5ba644a2fbb11e4bd236efec068c24d9c71b","dd0691bb4a50276a94fbb2835744ee334631fc10","27ce9bbdae6876efe897b3b66af9428fc547caaa","935f14e43d08d841154117964481506c2cafeb44","7b33a31646908247e10aabc4ab8c18c81d1671f8","4167cb6accae91be0f6dd467e6ac1af0842a8b63","bec60a0408e5fc0f7f57b9a4e9bbec491711bac3"],"outCitations":["575bc959d2f1ef14b3bb44fb8dc8239f1120b77f","511262ab4334690de18e72eb67a9574c266941cd","8b653159e55dbac7130403cafcc9d3e86eb47ab9","48bcf4914f2afac995681d3a76e22d8d499f41c1","4ebd998b8944e3f93c57816c71f39d74cd18c9d8","0064abe8e4739e5f56ab1a410d1acb548ae3a329","4c29b2b685e2356f76f0b7904c722ffdd9fb32c3","a34f6c469bcfd6a2623b6b95f4854187cef4f2cb","8ee117f1411f8aa4e089934e313b28ea630cb4b3","cf47280c1b42370de1c8e64c4f462e729e924b0b","313ec6397faaacee7913d78f8232c4e546db960c","11dcd2bade1e306495636aca2fdf9b27fbde1ede","968eee343b1cbc8db860bd38cfdf3e2d469f51fe","ab5716fcabcdf2a1359d7140913e140287190cf0","9d16d44edbee8ef87e0b2a7c0fed8c0a2b7eeb39"],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c62442ffe49d1ff099e83e6dae191182ccfd5486","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"Procedia Computer Science","journalVolume":"120","journalPages":"580-587","doi":"10.1016/J.PROCS.2017.11.282","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/J.PROCS.2017.11.282","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2774595495","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"2bc7aba1cd249c7e7313dd2e740ff239fea2c10b","title":"An Intelligent-Model for Automatic Brain-Tumor Diagnosis based-on MRI Images","paperAbstract":"brain tumor is the growth of abnormal cells within the brain; and it can be benign or malignant. Traditional diagnostic techniques involve invasive techniques such as biopsy, lumbar puncture and spinal tap method, to detect and classify brain tumors. A computer aided diagnosis algorithm has been designed so as to increase the accuracy of brain tumor detection and classification, and thereby replace conventional invasive and time consuming techniques. One of the most effective and common tool for diagnostic and treatment evaluation for brain interpretation has been magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study an Intelligent-Model for Automatic Brain-Tumor Diagnosis Based-on MRI Images was introduced; in which, the (MR) images are classified into normal, Edema, Cancer, or Not classified. The proposed method consists of three stages: In the first stage a preprocessing of brain image is done to remove the noise and to increase and enhance the contrast using multiple steps, secondly texture features was extracted, and then reduced dimensionality based on PCA, and finally Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) based-on Pearson correlation coefficient was used to classify the brain images.

In terms of segmentation efficiency Fuzzy clustering using fuzzy local information C-means algorithm proved to be greater over the other clustering methodologies. Most Research in developed countries show that the number of people who have brain cancer were died due to the fact of inaccurate detection and not in time. Generally, CT scan or MRI that is directed into intracranial cavity produces a complete image of brain. This image is visually examined by the physician for detection & diagnosis of brain cancer. However this method of detection resists the accurate determination of size of lump. In addition, it also reduces the time for analysis. At the end of the process the lump is extracted from the MR image and its exact position and the shape also determined. The graph based on pixel value is drawn taking the various points from the swelled cells lies in the original position from the affected region. Here the affected region is considered as ellipsoid shape and the volumes have been calculated from it. A fuzzy level set algorithm is proposed in this paper to facilitate medical image segmentation & on this performance of evaluation of the proposed algorithm was carried.","authors":[{"name":"Pritam R.

Automating this process is challenging due to the high diversity in appearance of tumor tissue, among different patients and, in many cases, similarity between tumor and normal tissue. One other challenge is how to make use of prior information about the appearance of normal brain. In this paper we propose a variational brain tumor segmentation algorithm that extends current approaches from texture segmentation by using a high dimensional feature set calculated from MRI data and registered atlases. Using manually segmented data we learn a statistical model for tumor and normal tissue. We show that using a conditional model to discriminate between normal and abnormal regions significantly improves the segmentation results compared to traditional generative models.

Therefore, detecting a tumor at an early stage can be easier for treatment and then rescue someone from death. The objective of biomedical image processing is that the image will be enhanced and then segmented to support doctors more easily in diagnosing and treating. This paper proposes with the segmentation method to separate brain MRI image for edge detection of tumor structure. In particular, an MRI brain image can be enhanced using unsharp approach before segmentation of the MRI image using the Otsu method. The Otsu allows us to detect a suitable threshold to segment the tumor part from the image. After the threshold detection, the binary image will appear some objects. Therefore, the image will be labeled to create a binary image with the completely white tumor region for accurately determining the view of the region in the image. Thus, the tumor image edge will be found using the unsharp masks, particularly, the edge image will be processed to combine with the original for displacing the segmented image for estimate of image structure. Simulation results on a brain MRI image set will show that the proposed method is the effectiveness and it can be developed for detection of benign and malignant tumors in biomedical images.","authors":[{"name":"Pham N.

In this work, the authors propose a novel method for generation of sCT based on dense cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (cycle GAN), a deep-learning based model that trains two transformation mappings (MRI to CT and CT to MRI) simultaneously.\n\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS\nThe cycle GAN-based model was developed to generate sCT images in a patch-based framework. Cycle GAN was applied to this problem because it includes an inverse transformation from CT to MRI, which helps constrain the model to learn a one-to-one mapping. Dense block-based networks were used to construct generator of cycle GAN. The network weights and variables were optimized via a gradient difference (GD) loss and a novel distance loss metric between sCT and original CT.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLeave-one-out cross-validation was performed to validate the proposed model. The mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and normalized cross correlation (NCC) indexes were used to quantify the differences between the sCT and original planning CT images. For the proposed method, the mean MAE between sCT and CT were 55.7 Hounsfield units (HU) for 24 brain cancer patients and 50.8 HU for 20 prostate cancer patients. The mean PSNR and NCC were 26.6 dB and 0.963 in the brain cases, and 24.5 dB and 0.929 in the pelvis.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe developed and validated a novel learning-based approach to generate CT images from routine MRIs based on dense cycle GAN model to effectively capture the relationship between the CT and MRIs. The proposed method can generate robust, high-quality sCT in minutes. The proposed method offers strong potential for supporting near real-time MRI-only treatment planning in the brain and pelvis.","authors":[{"name":"Yang  Lei","ids":["49381364"]},{"name":"Joseph

science and technology. A brain tumor is a distinctive and abandoned enlargement of brain cells, which are the source of death associated with cancer. Early detection of the brain tumors will cut the unconditional deaths of young people. Detection of brain tumor is complex because of the complex size of the brain. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Images) can give detail information with respect to the tissue life systems, which is for the recognition of brain tumors. Distinctive phases are included for the recognition of Brain Tumor i.e. pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Diagnostic MRI system corresponds to automated system involving enhancement of segmentation and classification process is discussed in this paper. The segmentation is the initial step that segments the benign and malignant tumor by utilizing filtering techniques available in image processing and then the classification approach to be executed. Modified median filter and multi-vector segmentation machine is used to form the segmented tumor region in the images. At the last stage, the implementation of the suggested techniques evaluated with multi support vector algorithm which distinguishes the tumor and MRI images. The proposed method efficiency increased in terms of RBF accuracy and linear accuracy. The performance analysis shows 10% betterment as compared to system exclusive of the application of modified median filtering with intensity adjustment feature.","authors":[{"name":"Prabhpreet  Kaur","ids":["1948699"]},{"name":"Gurvinder  Singh","ids":["47141166"]},{"name":"Parminder  Kaur","ids":["49004136"]}],"inCitations":["a61a9b9cc731c11cdf89e80883e3b2c492f39bca"],"outCitations":["1cf15f62f743eb69dddfc76271da69b2518cdf1a","e44a98c6656562e96abcc39841e96b258ac2d265","b42144c489ac4c09b43897b85d97293ccfe1d8b4","cfc6d0c8260594ebc5dd20ee558d29b1014ed41a","f775b61f46c73e0b372f01afab741ce67570857f","420f3f1078a6d8e0696572c032877079286051c6","036c7a5d2b50ae5321b6706dc262ab78adfc5f3c","f86ddd89dd7f3eda27acf619e7bda72a6dae7975","b1015f793eaf29969aae1ae7144493939066802a","1c2a4e793ad35eb326ade4eaea47808a32d14257","6aeb17f02edf4b6ebc72549e34dba8aadbe8bf19","31cc0304808d1ee85b1ace5dfbce7939b8101940","94f50648bfc62d380c7cb6b81e17c8a81d7b7d6e","ddf1b46e6c72f4ba3ab82c10a59aaeaae288fc1e","30a62e3c69ec6b6b781d4f75c1c25d2d4ac1fd96","4b674d20414903a2b368e3348c7f6712649745e5","659463c02b209f00469bab4649d361912954e4f3","4f46e52b9df9c7ce62ef085de2616a4092f174fb","45398fecc0f01f734a1a241dd0f12092e3b2b39f","1e72bc06f5393bdff145e5a2cc6c7c820c52dceb","91dc37e4da622afe495f95aba708611087fbf4aa"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a38f1f43698f1b5a32ad13b27864c7a7d974da6f","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"172-189","doi":"10.1007/978-981-15-1420-3_19","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-1420-3_19","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3027786915","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"f17a53c3d0f49c819a5046c1a5b4aa223ee20d93","title":"An effective tumor detection approach using denoised MRI based on fuzzy bayesian segmentation approach","paperAbstract":"In the cancer treatment, the accurate segmentation of the brain tumor is a major task for which the denoised image gains major significance. This paper proposes an effective segmentation of the brain tumor for accurate detection of the brain tumors using the MRI brain image. The tumor is segmented using the proposed fuzzy Bayesian cut brain tumor segmentation approach. Initially, the noise from the MRI images is removed using the image denoising algorithm, known as Taylor-Krill Herd-based SVM algorithm. The denoised MRI output from the filter is then subjected to tumor segmentation using the proposed Fuzzy Bayesian cut brain tumor segmentation approach, which is the inclusion of the fuzzy and Gaussian naive bayes concept in the tumor cut algorithm in order to enable effective segmentation. The experimentation is performed using the BraTS database and simulated BraTS database and the comparative analysis of the proposed Fuzzy Bayesian cut brain tumor segmentation approach is performed with the other state-of-the-art method based on the metrics, such as accuracy, Jaccard similarity, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The simulation results reveal that the proposed method acquired a maximum accuracy of 0.9903, by considering the Rayleigh noise using simulated BRaTS database, which is 0.20%, 0.33%, and 0.02%, better than the existing methods, such as original tumor cut, wiener filter + fuzzy Bayesian cut algorithm, and median filter + fuzzy Bayesian cut algorithm, respectively.","authors":[{"name":"C.

In the present study, we have developed a novel gradient-based EPT approach with greatly improved tissue boundary reconstruction and largely elevated robustness against measurement noise compared to existing techniques. Using a 7 Tesla MRI system, we report, for the first time, high-quality in vivo human brain electrical property images with refined structural details, which can potentially merit clinical diagnosis (such as cancer detection) and high-field MRI applications (quantification of local specific absorption rate) in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Jiaen  Liu","ids":["2108256711"]},{"name":"Xiaotong  Zhang","ids":["2108015770"]},{"name":"Sebastian  Schmitter","ids":["2997815"]},{"name":"Pierre-François van de Moortele","ids":["46255928"]},{"name":"Bin  He","ids":["143603425"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["77eb7bf0f1c6797607ce8a5c59fe4b30a51d8a69","4fe240f62706c87edd55224c09ffd293578f9eb9","677a1357a70817f3aa0d1a31641bee6d182139e8","49762723f9d8ede59f2d788fb9d3c89312422bd9","b190c491122b5290cc8387eff82f09fcb7992d2c","57fcabe38757969100a45c8a0a5458a482b5bef2","e649d425f74a13db88cfbdd8ea88ca04a2450f79","631c6bc9d9e91c4606a775247f381b2305bc408e","5535c5284217dec155bf67736cf10d80ff9cb3ff","a8941352b54c27444e6325925245340a19dd0543","3618e021d7eb4036ae55ffaeee2a3972cf3ffe9f","1c22b51954f132f45657929ce032c0a942d6b31d","648b20854b97a76fda05afca88da8dd2d62a1202","5d50f9b6d7d76180613e7b66bff8eb2de6bee5f3","0e5e9daa4b548575453f23e6398b36d9df4d423a","33173d5247333870ac8c248efe019ac00bc9d1cd","da03a90ef889ade587cd6b1ff9fcbf1f45314f96","61dab61a093d6cbca389100b6b72f74940aff49f","e0479a0d9b8be158914788be10449dce49c8c589","e5527a964564b2bead232c47678ab9a7dd89e208","a977be457b76f54ee805791659bc2592f275b201","67bcfaca92252aed49fdf7584df14e8e9c9c4271","cfb5868719af6bbd92daaa69d18453e984de1881","5a3b4f1f2f963923448e26d2735cf1202aa364ed","17c591b542c9dee9b2ee8e151ba0d03c09074cd3","a107b06f508d764c2541904b13f06d6677df3b33","749c57c6b56ef3a76c63d9189ca84b3415493c62","98e1a27edcfd164e3127e7f78ca56a20fdb8d2da","50a0e471d65a068ecb763659bafbdabaad5dd9ea","57b8f67ebee7d280e6b833ea60dfba52739bbeb6"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/909f6b0dea909f8ed5e0085c1af908d5a88901b9","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q30413801"],"venue":"2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","journalName":"2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"6056-6059","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945010","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945010","pmid":"25571378","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science","Medicine","Computer Science"],"magId":"2148729974","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"bf4dc3ca2bbf1d8fd000f755b103f31e0e672f39","title":"Multifunctional nanoparticle platforms for in vivo MRI enhancement and photodynamic therapy of a rat brain cancer","paperAbstract":"Abstract A paradigm for brain cancer detection, treatment, and monitoring is established.

subjects that are paired usually are not identically the same, asymmetry is perfectly normal but sometimes asymmetry can be noticeable too much. Structural and functional asymmetry in the human brain and nervous system is reviewed in a historical perspective. Brain asymmetry is one of such examples, which is a difference in size or shape, or both. Asymmetry analysis of brain has great importance because it is not only indicator for brain cancer but also predict future potential risk for the same. In our work, we have concentrated to segment the anatomical regions of brain, isolate the two halves of brain and to investigate each half for the presence of asymmetry of anatomical regions in MRI.","authors":[{"name":"B  SamirKumar","ids":["152112139"]},{"name":"yopadhyay","ids":["81441744"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2011,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8a601cc583e3337babb0b3d05bef367b3e36e642","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"Journal of Global Research in Computer Sciences","journalVolume":"2","journalPages":"33-37","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2991912038","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"b2a37d5daf89c5fbeed03bd4bc735131e6ee4b80","title":"Dendrimer-based magnetic resonance imaging agents for brain cancer","paperAbstract":"Brain cancer is one of the most lethal and difficult-to-treat cancers because of its physical location and biological barriers. The mainstay of brain cancer treatment is surgical resection, which demands precise imaging for tumor localization and delineation. Thanks to advances in bioimaging, brain cancer can be detected earlier and resected more reliably. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most common and preferred method to delineate brain cancer, and a contrast agent is often required to enhance imaging contrast. Dendrimers, a special family of synthetic macromolecules, constitute a particularly appealing platform for constructing MRI contrast agents by virtue of their well-defined three-dimensional structure, tunable nanosize and abundant surface terminals, which allow the accommodation of high payloads and numerous functionalities. Tuning the dendrimer size, branching and surface composition in conjunction with conjugation of MRI functionalities and targeting moieties can alter the relaxivity for MRI, overcome the blood-brain barrier and enhance tumor-specific targeting, hence improving the imaging quality and safety profile for precise and accurate imaging of brain tumors. This short review highlights the recent progress, opportunities and challenges in developing dendrimer-based MRI contrast agents for brain tumor imaging.摘要脑癌由于其特殊的生理位置和血脑屏障, 是一种难以治疗的致命肿瘤. 手术切除是目前脑癌的主要治疗手段, 然而成功的手术需要 精确的肿瘤定位和肿瘤成像以确保完全切除癌细胞并避免伤害正常脑组织. 磁共振成像是诊断脑癌最常见的成像方法, 但通常需要造影 剂来增强成像对比度和精准度. 树型分子因其独特的精准三维结构, 可调控的纳米尺寸和众多的表面官能团, 可作为构建磁共振成像造影 剂的优选材料. 藉由调整树型分子的尺寸、使用不同的分支结构和表面官能团修饰(包括磁共振成像功能团和脑肿瘤靶向基团), 可以改 善造影剂的弛豫性, 克服血脑屏障并增强肿瘤靶向能力, 从而改善成像质量以获得精准的脑瘤成像, 并提高造影剂的安全性. 本文简要总 结了基于树型分子的磁共振成像造影剂在脑癌成像应用中的挑战、最新进展、机遇和未来发展趋势.","authors":[{"name":"Ling

Survey","paperAbstract":"In recent years, improved deep learning techniques have been applied to biomedical image processing for the classification and segmentation of different tumors based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological imaging (H&E) clinical information. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) architectures include tens to hundreds of processing layers that can extract multiple levels of features in image-based data, which would be otherwise very difficult and time-consuming to be recognized and extracted by experts for classification of tumors into different tumor types, as well as segmentation of tumor images. This article summarizes the latest studies of deep learning techniques applied to three different kinds of brain cancer medical images (histology, magnetic resonance, and computed tomography) and highlights current challenges in the field for the broader applicability of DCNN in personalized brain cancer care by focusing on two main applications of DCNNs: classification and segmentation of

automated neurological disorder identification system that uses computer vision on magnetic resonance imaging to locate brain tumors (MRI). The most common and dangerous form of brain cancer is gliomas. Gliomas are tumors that, at their most advanced stage, result in a much shorter life span. Preparing for therapy is an important step in maintaining a better quality of life for oncology patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique for examining the structures and components of the human body as well as for medical diagnosis, determining the stage of disease, and monitoring without the use of ionizing radiation. The significant spatial and structural changeability of brain tumors complicates segmentation. As a result, an automatic and consistent segmentation technique is used, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Because of the relatively low number of network weights, the use of small kernels enables the development of a deeper architecture, with such a positive effect on over-fitting. It also explores the use of intensity normalization as a pre-processing phase, which is not widely used in segmentation techniques based on the Convolution Neural Network, but has been shown to be efficient in segmenting brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in conjunction with data augmentation.","authors":[{"name":"Pranav  Shetty","ids":["47092843"]},{"name":"Suraj  Singh","ids":["2109041239"]},{"name":"Rasvi  Jambhulkar","ids":["2088498565"]},{"name":"Kajal  Sheth","ids":["2088549000"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["09ff558855d6f236a556863b79bb42dfbb1327a1","420f3f1078a6d8e0696572c032877079286051c6","009ba4044ea780c610f244dbd309a3bea11ce258","d7f78690a137057db7a958a9684982583f72e9fa","e12443eb6045ba49556ab7b9dc1c4404b24215d1","854d9940cc687087fae0bc09379056e6a6bedb71","9e3884d632a7b536862d2648ab4109386162636a","8fb24c3555e6402e99973a290865c04eb088bdf3","b71cbc73c5e435cef02a5187a794efe8dfd85037","0eab464b016b6f242cbe1afdde2b35e039ee0bd6","37d7c9c10b1380e745c07b2af5572f34774bd54b","9e7ce336c8fea4b87bf68f83a23e262c58310cea","f3f89c3e0264c4c7f8b3e8aab0b388f896fba493"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/403efafd869c228d8919ad40c902a3214e1874b4","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.allresearchjournal.com/archives/2021/vol7issue5/PartE/7-5-22-371.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International journal of applied research","journalVolume":"7","journalPages":"308-313","doi":"10.22271/ALLRESEARCH.2021.V7.I5E.8585","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22271/ALLRESEARCH.2021.V7.I5E.8585","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3168677173","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"7fa71a721d1a503ca3fc2071677d134e99cb6024","title":"Brain Tumor Segmentation from 3D MRI Slices Using Cascading Convolutional Neural Network","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor accounts for 80–90% of all primary CNS tumors. Brain cancer is tenth leading cause of death. Automatic detection and classification can help in early diagnosis and deliver efficient treatment. Recent developments in medical imaging modalities such as MRI provide insightful image of our brain. Due to large amount data and variability of data, diagnosing in faster and proper manner is not humanly possible. In this paper, we focus on segmentation of brain tumor of 3D MRI images using 3D CNN in cascading format. Whole tumor is extracted from the images through the first CNN model, then the output is fed to the next CNN model to extract the core tumor and finally, it is fed to the last CNN of cascading network to segment the enhanced tumor core. To improve the brain tumor segmentation, three neural networks belonging to the class of convoluted neural networks (CNNs) were connected having 20 interconnected kernel slices with four downsampling slices to trade off simplicity with feature extraction. The proposed method was evaluated by considering Brats 2015 3D dataset consisting of 274 MRI images with their ground truth having different four modalities. The activation function used was Relu and the results obtained were calculated over DICE coefficient (F-measure) which was found to be 0.78 for core tumor in flair modalities.","authors":[{"name":"Suchismita  Das","ids":["2109618631"]},{"name":"Mahesh Kumar Swain","ids":["2089841637"]},{"name":"G.

However, identifying brain MRI scans that have full or near-full coverage among a large number (e.g. >5000) of scans comprising both head/brain and other body parts is a time-consuming task that cannot be automated with the use of the information stored in the DICOM header attributes alone. Depending on the clinical scenario, an entire set of scans acquired in a single visit may often be labelled “BRAIN” in the DICOM field 0018,0015 (Body Part Examined), while the individual scans will often not only include brain scans with full coverage, but also others with partial brain coverage, scans of the spinal cord, and in some cases other body parts. DICOM field 0018,1250 (Receive Coil Name) can be used to determine the type of receiver coil used, however, the use of a head coil does not guarantee a full-brain MRI scan. At other times another type of receiver coil such as a ‘dual coil’ may have been used, or the 0018,1250 (Receive Coil Name) attribute may be blank. Similarly, determining the field-of-view from the DICOM attributes is not sufficiently informative to detect full or near-full coverage brain scans, even if a brain scan is guaranteed. Furthermore, some datasets may have been converted to other formats such as the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIFTI) format, with no access to the source DICOM files, and the associated tags. In other cases, DICOM files may be available but with no useful information in their headers, for example, if the DICOM files have been produced by the conversion of old plain-films, or as in legacy datasets. The imaging catalogue of the average hospital is too large to be manually checked, let alone labelled: a comprehensive framework for rendering imaging robustly auditable requires a fully automated process. In this article, we introduce Neurosense, a trained, convolutional, deep neural network that efficiently performs this task.

The risks involved in carrying out surgery within a brain can cause severe anxiety in patients. However, primary surgical resection which is one of the most effective ways of treating brain tumors can have a tremendously increased success rate if the appropriate imaging modality is used for complete tumor resection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for brain tumor imaging because of its excellent soft-tissue contrast. MRI combined with continuum soft robotics has immense potential to be the next major technological breakthrough in the field of brain cancer diagnosis and therapy. In this work, we present the design and kinematic analysis of a flexible spring-based minimally invasive neurosurgical intracranial robot (MINIR-II). It is comprised of an inter-connected inner spring and an outer spring to enable motion in three dimensions (3D). Our design provides improved dexterity with higher degrees of freedom (DoFs) and independent joint control because of the centrally routed tendon configuration. Since the robot itself is made of plastic (except the electrocautery probes and SMA spring actuators), it is MRI-compatible and allows surgeons to track the real-time location of the robot in the brain and to reach the brain tumor target. The inter-connected spring and the outer spring are manufactured individually in a single piece using rapid prototyping technology at low cost to make it disposable after single use.

Without complicated calculation, a semiquantitative parameter – modified initial area under the curve (mIAUCc) – was proposed for better correlation with volume transfer constant (Ktrans) by computer simulation. In this study, we aim to further investigate the correlation between mIAUCc and Ktrans in clinical. A total of 10 patients with brain tumors participated in this study and images were acquired by using a 3‐Tesla clinical MR scanner. The results showed that mIAUCc was highly correlated with Ktrans with the correlation coefficient of 0.913. Although the ideals of Ktrans and mIAUCc are different, mIAUCc does the trick for brain tumors evaluations in DCE‐MRI. It reveals that mIAUCc could be an alternative for physiological condition evaluation in DCE‐MRI. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Cancer incidence rate is growing at an alarming rate in the world. Great knowledge and experience on radiology are required for accurate tumor detection in medical imaging. Automation of tumor detection is required because there might be a shortage of skilled radiologists at a time of great need. This paper reviews the processes and techniques used in detecting tumor based on medical imaging results such as mammograms, x-ray computed tomography (x-ray CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI image which is the Magnetic Resonance Imaging is also could be used for diagnosisand discover which is the type of the human brain that has been tested is normal or abnormal. Moreover, the MRI images give an observation and useful information that will help the doctors and surgeries to avoid some mistakes that will happen during the testing and the diagnosis process. Also, MRI characteristics are used for avoiding human error in manual interpretation of medical content. One of the most popular and useful application that the medical system in need is the MRI brain image classification approach. In this paper, we proposed a new clustering algorithm which relies on the differences between the contrast level of the tumor in the MRI. We depend on new approach for image clustering which is based on the difference between the construct (which is the intensity level) between the tumor region and the whole MRI image. In contrast, other algorithms like k-means, Fuzzy c-means, or probabilistic c-means depend on typical approach which is based on the distance majority between each point (pixel) and its mean. Our work consists some preprocessing steps like smoothed and enhanced the MRI by using enhancement techniques such as Gaussian kernel, median filter, high-pass filter, and Morphological image operation. Mainly, the proposed clustering algorithm in this work uses for segmentation of the image to detect the suspicious region of the tumor in brain MRI image. In this paper feature our results have been compared with the traditional clustering algorithm such as k-means and watershed.","authors":[{"name":"Adil  Al-Azzawi","ids":["1410082314"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["a1bee15f1b8a366561828570d7b34166126bff6c","d0256a1162bcec55165f3771ab2e7e48c35fc540","9e9c6a18a3427ddb9ba649930748e3a7f6944e4b","f2511889c18ae91346f001dad03f70062d3886b4","612c3febed5871d6ac912d61573f7bc88eb079cb","2c463baecc884e9ff0e2657335204b70619f007a","c42579df9b95fdc28592d55be9650dccdcf8c461","f9fa30e0331c8d948c883a5217e0f82ea6a6e130","ad190bc250bb16202a032a5a2ba50fd1085c3c79","2e957b7df6d6684fdf467cf4b8c73b38c8a06c96","f3f89c3e0264c4c7f8b3e8aab0b388f896fba493","6e90250cc8c60e01bc51d34a9aa4ba529e945390","8a4efffb30f5128a104de628c180b741380ab583"],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6a209878dd68ad964bbcd84721216f21c5383eaf","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.rroij.com/open-access/contrast-level-testbased-methodology-for-speedup-mri-brain-tumor-detection-and-localization-approach-.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering","journalVolume":"4","journalPages":"17101-17109","doi":"10.15680/IJIRCCE.2016.0410001","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15680/IJIRCCE.2016.0410001","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2546927274","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"dd926d3b665ec12cb5117255561c2d6f0d0e1708","title":"Bone Cancer Diagnosis Using GGD Analysis","paperAbstract":"Bone sarcoma, usually known as bone cancer, is a rare type of cancer that refers to an abnormal growth of tissue inside the bone, with high probability to spread to other parts of the body. It commonly affects children, teenagers and young adults. As for all other types of cancer (breast, lung, prostate, stomach, brain …), there are no identified causes for bone cancer. Therefore, only an early detection could help increasing the chances to survive a bone sarcoma. The association of medical imaging modalities (such as X-ray, MRI and CT imaging) with image processing techniques can provide more accuracy while detection eventual bone tumors. In this paper, we introduced a new method for sarcoma diagnosis, using a Generalized Gaussian Density analysis (GGD). The process starts by generating sub-images of a given size from the processed bone MRI and conducting a GGD analysis on each of the sub-images. Then, a region of interest(ROI) corresponding to the sub-images with the highest value of the shape parameter a is selected from the original MRI. An Euclidean distance criteria is then used to adjust the ROI from which the bone tumor is identified using a connected component analysis algorithm. The proposed technique was tested on several bones MRI and has given perfect tumors detection compared to the literature.","authors":[{"name":"Hela  Boulehmi","ids":["3369129"]},{"name":"Hela  Mahersia","ids":["2601939"]},{"name":"Kamel  Hamrouni","ids":["2186757"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["b22552339e3ba20b4b0107499b9c977fbac756ed","f6a41077a760717c68fa9d09ff8db1f880c12ccd","ce9cf04fb81948ec8af08d26311f4ecf5a6a71ca","d6081e4e84d82a4748a025fcc6b273a8a032d58c","b9648883a5b559b11b024a5f764daeaefbc22cb1","652aafbf2d29ad36c1c7ec6cd9c762d553f7d68a","d4ae1b2b2ddebce822d883abe576f975cd5eb2d9","147e93184cd4b13a1423dbe5bca0c706cbc5b978"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dd926d3b665ec12cb5117255561c2d6f0d0e1708","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/SSD.2018.8570658"],"venue":"2018 15th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals & Devices (SSD)","journalName":"2018 15th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals & Devices (SSD)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"246-251","doi":"10.1109/SSD.2018.8570658","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSD.2018.8570658","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Computer Science"],"magId":"2903920828","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"83614797e1d84e11b418fee7baa66d1aeb4da41a","title":"An Employment of Probabilistic Neural Network in Magnetic Resonance Imaging For Early Brain Cancer Detection","paperAbstract":"Given the circumstances of the countries in which wars, political instability, and other uncertainties are passing that make the atmosphere impure, which have caused many diseases, one of these diseases that has spread widely is cancer. Cancer is a very common disease, and many of them affect a person and lead him or her to death. Among these diseases, which have been common in recent years specifically the brain tumors that they need early diagnosis and do not cause the death of the person. Furthermore, many studies in the field of brain cancer detection have been done, but the best solution is still missing. Therefore, in this paper, a reliable method is proposed to detect brain tumors, extract its properties, and classify the tumor using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) through the artificial neural network.  In the proposed system, an essential part of image processing is the analysis and processing of digital images, especially to improve their quality, Bilateral Filter is used to improving image clarity and any image noise in this method preserves edges. After that, the distinctive properties of the image are extracted using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) method. Thus, the extracted features are strong and can be classified as a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), this is what distinguishes our work from the previous works. The advantage obtained is granted to the PNN Classifier, which is used to train and test the accuracy of performance in perceiving the location of the tumour in MRI images of the brain accuracy as it resolves 99.5%.","authors":[{"name":"Seba Aziz Sahym","ids":["2100850707"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83614797e1d84e11b418fee7baa66d1aeb4da41a","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"12","journalPages":"2584-2592","doi":"10.17762/TURCOMAT.V12I2.2225","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17762/TURCOMAT.V12I2.2225","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3155514172","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"17b57598536193c27867ebd238bdffd8e8bab055","title":"Identification and grouping of brain related tumors by applying hybrid LSF model","paperAbstract":"This paper explores how technological advances can help in better diagnosis of cancer affected region of the brain.

A technique of localized and vectorial TMS has enabled us to obtain non-invasive functional mapping of the human brain. The development of new bioimaging technologies such as current distribution MRI and conductivity MRI potentially enables us to understand the dynamics of brain functions, which include millisecond-level changes in functional regions and dynamic relations between brain neuronal networks. These techniques are leading medicine and biology into a new horizon through the novel applications of magnetism. A lecture on current limiter intended specifically for engineering students pursuing specialization with Electrical and Electronics engineering is proposed in this paper. The important information which doesn’t appear in text books are presented to the students. A general overview of different techniques of limiting fault current in electric power systems with special emphasis on two types of current limiters based on passive magnetic materials and high temperature superconducting materials have been presented. Simple laboratory experiments are also proposed to validate the theoretical knowledge.","authors":[{"name":"Shoogo  Ueno","ids":["2069219"]},{"name":"Masaki  Sekino","ids":["2986805"]}],"inCitations":["f8b5090ea9fd9ebc721733a6df6331f78dbae3b2"],"outCitations":["2df44122bc604082ac93209d71476c5318abc744","8b2ede16ec211a8a012ec15d391013f94baca99e","456102d1d436b6faf502b67d4e2f37310915e6e1","b999af7c23ab69464467239ef80a27189e4955dc","10b6ada9ec5021790d155e232cf8680b8daa8580","8520b99bdfbf391d2036764361a381b430fb8226","9fa7060c204089fd0b180320c4889aa1c31aa307","9a02a7c16a38b26ba8938a5be85f342436489d6c","e25434147537839ecaa00d2fc1393514bdbed746","e17df02ecab1592bd798b734b1ea81e6b3ff2196","e5398c77e50734d7b80110f5225f64b6e3f7e1c1","a5254f003bf186b81c85da0b62b4fb6a3bd7818b","ab9c323f5cf489dedd27459f650f897b60018cf9","32f6249d4e7854175fe72425a21e1a8f6921aeb3","11801af8a4c3ee0bd7c9ac9558818512365222cb","7f9de0cbba409ed030442836b878119c5aedb545","99153e623123fb06757d36dc17cef795bd9aedc2","039920c36d3ab2d102a91905e1ae11d3dfeb3e57","e8ce45fb9ea6e598393bfa1609d0c26d7160168c","b940297e7337984b28395ad0f7aee913f644ef07","dd4d793d7637365dc5cbaff375fed89e43eabf76","f7afee6fdeddc2c1c9b6cd3498c7fc148286d4e7","7d38a9bb16145a7ac4a3b2d7ab5473129031d2b0"],"year":2008,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6f88ab44afc82efe5952d2b388c6118251ba029d","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.exeley.com/exeley/journals/in_jour_smart_sensing_and_intelligent_systems/1/1/pdf/10.21307_ijssis-2017-292.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal on Smart Sensing and Intelligent Systems","journalVolume":"1","journalPages":"300-314","doi":"10.21307/IJSSIS-2017-292","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21307/IJSSIS-2017-292","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"2768044201","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"77099a016032142b0c52bd82a7190f3db977f7b6","title":"Comparative Study of various techniques using Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Detection","paperAbstract":"One of the life-threatening disease affecting the brain is the cancer of the brain.

Doctors use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to detect and locate tumors in the brain, and very carefully analyze scans to segment brain tumors. Manual segmentation is time consuming and tiring for doctors, and it can be difficult for them to notice extremely small abnormalities. Automated segmentations performed by computers offer quicker diagnoses, the ability to notice small details, and more accurate segmentations. Advances in deep learning and computer hardware have allowed for high-performing automated segmentation approaches. However, several problems persist in practice: increased training time, class imbalance, and low performance. In this paper, I propose applying V-Net, a volumetric, fully convolutional neural network, to segment brain tumors in MRI scans from the BraTS Challenges. With this approach, I achieve a whole tumor dice score of 0.89 and train the network in a short time while addressing class imbalance with the use of a dice loss layer. Then, I propose applying an existing technique to improve automated segmentation performance in practice.","authors":[{"name":"Ryan  Sherman","ids":["2056938104"]}],"inCitations":["5b9658e593c2bcdcf49de9f848eabf6d7eb75fc0","6da5ecf4eab1e752839894461621e38b0ea466f3","5e9bbef99d1f355eb2214152c2f32c79ff4d7edc"],"outCitations":["4fb974342e6aba8825064ac30983eac922d0bae9","976050a0d225313224bd74f1608d20c5ac35577f","10c7ce3986da6f6e0c253f89556bed5b3339de3b","9b6f5e4cb8f2163fe400f1315bca976623e33b28","31f10a6f602bef0306ac37322f84f6163c8a8ecb","0f84a81f431b18a78bd97f59ed4b9d8eda390970","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","7c2bcf6f32b05a04cd3444c030db743e5666af88","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","713f73ce5c3013d9fb796c21b981dc6629af0bd5","50432703c89002134deff6a07691b5cc4a53a694","1af44da4f2b4fd8abb9f2f1061ad1503cb016491","50004c086ffd6a201a4b782281aaa930fbfe6ecf","01f7481512f9203dc805d71a9134aa14cecf25d0","89d4eaf0b38523322c891ed159229ae89f2aaaef","c01f6960618c9b357832d6d654c6bc2af4c90b84","d641f94b22939b47c2667a9d20a3cef230213d5e","cc83eabf4f833b8c92dcf6012dcce348591d060f","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","7f5fc84819c0cf94b771fe15141f65b123f7b8ec","1339a092822f87f02e4b743c2b80bd3ada3c64fc","c2c0fda9b4e2a12fd4069ab545e90ec4a197e66d","4f17e652b2e090c93175eec37dfcd862c848113c","d11e2caf177686536879226b14e089c9382dbb30","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03884a9581446859bb31e4d8c73fa3b70184666e","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02654","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02654","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02654v1.pdf"],"venue":"ArXiv","journalName":"ArXiv","journalVolume":"abs/1811.02654","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Mathematics"],"magId":"2900337631","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"49eab0f8ea47b8eed71b5c4b88ed6878789ec77e","title":"Deep CNN for Brain Tumor Classification","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor represents one of the most fatal cancers around the world. It is common cancer in adults and children. It has the lowest survival rate and various types depending on their location, texture, and shape. The wrong classification of the tumor brain will lead to bad consequences. Consequently, identifying the correct type and grade of tumor in the early stages has an important role to choose a precise treatment plan. Examining the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of the patient’s brain represents an effective technique to distinguish brain tumors. Due to the big amounts of data and the various brain tumor types, the manual technique becomes time-consuming and can lead to human errors. Therefore, an automated computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) system is required. The recent evolution in image classification techniques has shown great progress especially the deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) which have succeeded in this area. In this regard, we exploited CNN for the problem of brain tumor classification. We suggested a new model, which contains various layers in the aim to classify MRI brain tumor. The proposed model is experimentally evaluated on three datasets. Experimental results affirm that the suggested approach provides a convincing performance compared to existing methods.","authors":[{"name":"Wadhah  Ayadi","ids":["39809681"]},{"name":"Wajdi  Elhamzi","ids":["2309288"]},{"name":"Imen  Charfi","ids":["2145048"]},{"name":"Mohamed  Atri","ids":["40406356"]}],"inCitations":["9a967f869e545fd1d8f0aa4f69f9fa857f5f1e66","963d73e7d46725d462dfa5060ecf9e44fc005f97"],"outCitations":["03d67da60612e60692b0bfdac1eedadc0a98905d","4e65851007154e6c6181707e210b9cbf343fdd5e","5d7e553efef5c707226c2a148d96a7c127e96a77","7681df2a5493531c988f425de1210919b67e6b4a","5e10a999925907c8018a10a338a3734e111c6c70","6bd462b3968c64410432dca27067234e321430b0","0fc9f9bfb6b6cabcbc77aaedc6fc7ce80484b5cf","99b5153235b0ee583803bbd7cd6bd9da161d5348","5a71700c7e74bf25d4d605e95db386c38e6a20d0","020018f11ca2ad64738ed40bae8c312e3db2b320","4130e4e00b52f8947a671116f2fd029cce8cac79","2b178f6143745be0dd560864fa223dd1656cfcb1","8c5b23bddd31b2360b092c0469e20821ec682511","07be044c675ac69cb5ce7982f337765a9d12fd78","2260472cd83efe88bbf66b2790b9b4a97cd04ba3","6edebe72678d4151cc169f1e47154098ab9d3f6b","14ab9fe14d9d7ac9f60b2a4dbaa2f4ca6c77ce20","524e95dca47b7c27f1be5d437ae86e2f0f4e7f21","2304e9e9fea67f7e8a87c44d9564b2407336f391","30763622cc38466d16dcdca06b47e4b05e5566ae","fbda3fbc619f8fb1e9cc2ee9072eda717f7ea6eb","2abde28f75a9135c8ed7c50ea16b7b9e49da0c09","2e3238f41752404dd94b29287871a2c203c0ede4","5d0abcbe11275a93c2fa1e896d06effa8d01c786","cd8c4ccb566ffbdb034d2f9430dbfb2fd6fdd5fe","d79e64f90000c1594dc6e12908ecdcddaac49459","1b97a135fc6f3bfe1e445d2ef0b18eb1e779e0bc","846aedd869a00c09b40f1f1f35673cb22bc87490","f4008deb11f6a2ec3d52dde72be48cd53c898a45","953cda30ae05a6e0d1910b5388087c9108c51866","dd58d810240fd6985ec9de35138919d5c695bab3","e74f9b7f8eec6ba4704c206b93bc8079af3da4bd","5eb03378d11882df750ed85742398942a9d11b03","a4ab1052c577e0183ff0a21cbaa0ac5e399b69df","251c39c1b9372f3055cd53d0001fc122bfb2e418","b4cf87c56427a9e02b1929d25a7696a29e4d0d7c","4ae5e21ee2141de8da0597d452bfdf0376e03bf5","5038eabefad5cfaa606d3085c1654f697fb509fb","e5dd646b3c4e52084a88075c6bcb2ad7fbe33237","ae20c630759847cd88655631d0041b0be127fd0c","223b96b99b4d4217e4914bf140ca8b8b80d5be9b","c9414160a8230ab14946f6a3355907e6d697b71e","53fdc26a7b538d64db93bed870c9e729cf46dbd2","5f2f6a697dabc784bbc4375f70d86df6a5de020a","234fbce9108195e579fe001837d85a470f97ef85","bc41e157183bace7a5ed81a892b9908e3fcdb7dc","e4e10d52d263cf4f6b8ab12dc820c1088e698ad1","4df6d7a0cbb230a446589dcb65ea0b09446b15b7","f82b7f3d3d6c0f8712432d899b4e55cca6bd3a8e","bda5e312bf1d12434d5eec5822af1698851e2692"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/49eab0f8ea47b8eed71b5c4b88ed6878789ec77e","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s11063-020-10398-2"],"venue":"Neural Process.

Prognosis of cancer demands trained medical professionals and effective clinical trials. Imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool for diagnosis. To enhance the quality of life of brain tumor patients improved examinations with non invasive treatments are required. It is an emerging area of research in both field medical as well as engineering field. The primary purpose is to develop an efficient tool which could be helpful in early detection of tumor. This study proposed a futuristic technique of analyzing the detection of tumor by comparing it with the normal brain data through machine learning classifiers. This paper deals with comparative study of pattern recognition and feature extraction of tumor from the primary data of image in terms of intensities obtained from MRI modality. Our contribution to an existing scenario is to provide with an analyzed data mining evidence of different classifiers specifically targeting Solid cum Cystic Tumor. Computational analysis from the available dataset is done through machine learning tool. MRI images are represented in grey scale level image. Mean intensity, variance and combination of both are considered as a feature classifier. Classification accuracy of datasets of brain tumor with normal brain is analyzed via machine learning classifiers. Matlab is used for Intensity feature extraction and WEKA machine learning software is used for classification testing. The experimental results clearly show classification accuracy. Among mean and variance, later shows more reliable result testing different algorithm. Variance can be taken into account as a prominent feature extraction for tumor detection.

The aim of this study is to investigate a new method in maximizing the probability of brain cancer type detection without actual biopsy procedure. The proposed method combines both image and statistical analysis for tumor type detection. It employed image filtration and segmentation of the target region of interest with MRI to assure an accurate statistical interpretation of the results. Statistical analysis was based on utilizing the mean, range, box plot, and testing of hypothesis techniques to reach acceptable and accurate results in differentiating between those two types. This method was performed, examined and compared on actual patients with brain tumors. The results showed that the proposed method was quite successful in distinguishing between malignant and benign brain tumor with 95% confident that the results are correct based on statistical testing of hypothesis.","authors":[{"name":"Bassam  Al-Naami","ids":["9494449"]},{"name":"Adnan  Bashir","ids":["2048142623"]},{"name":"Hani  Amasha","ids":["2871680"]},{"name":"Jamal  Al-Nabulsi","ids":["1403242582"]},{"name":"Abdul-Majeed  Almalty","ids":["1972954"]}],"inCitations":["7a50e1fb7573af93808edc4271e02bf5c0347345","e1e3f3ad706fe3f81b39d0897988baed44b43ae4","49e134bc5a71e5c5f531205cee7c3d4b08c779ba","4a5ff8673ac28ea969b76f33e1e08e9c02262b6c","924cc992bb5282bf3329ca6d2a0d27558e178955","64adafb89a07ed7df1b1d321156241f993fad8f1","566a6d2279c1c4beb0a694014cfc3e56b191af90","e02d2f987137a9d1dee4cdb2f054a39430c9a5f4","1db25642c21fc852a8097827c6235d0cd414781f","677a1c05cd4012ea5dddcf0ba026dcef7a61dbd8","07008284f217edc549f440bbe1b2bde5ea427d31","47c45ac256b19a71e6e66cc191862589a883ee72","41f74291fe8ca76eb9661ad316a258606fad5a8a","c48bfa5c8a5f58e45378baf9c9534edf2dcb5932","58428f5ffb74a6feead00ae34990a3a1a85991c4"],"outCitations":["0587f36ccb5e98e0702777a4bd7f28ec7597f09f","73a50f51a65826e573fa966cb9a1e3126023f2f1","d0ac7af4826ae1a2042aa5f114a3a5b3a9b00b70","b70b3e8584847b2ebf95613ab7ade841e638cdae","64bda8b75fcb70e60efc6816888fa7a0368f2c96","7052b1817793920168c0ad2dd73d2b8099eda073","e28156e79ad7b952af38b80d53b890c59b6d60a5","011853b590b0564ff8f534daaff67d579583ccd3","68dd0001849efd875d5a865c2c0962f9cc2efc75","6e111a3a2f2a0cb42061d36987077dd2344af3ac","8e76c9a23920c46aae4bd4ea0c34742f218580bc","ef79b548d9abe0627aca336374d2b2ecaf30cc6c","77eb5bd199de98adedf17d1db45fb4d3fef74388","3aaf49dc0ff97f96809be5c83ab4dd7d9ca3ebcf","63f7f7170fa010ebfe77958123a45a4994e984f8","7b7c0395b53dc45b0e5be97c7e9347a8a9e671cf","48bcf4914f2afac995681d3a76e22d8d499f41c1","4dafbbc0cd8eb3e9967dd6b8bfce216a4dd3c1fc","bcbde4f82a1d20da1a5d0d95a5a411b6432b0a85","7175ab6e69a38f7540da91f1afc64a015e2700da","26310c1bbf53d61202a45a8ffa2a7e126c5381e0","ec92f66a43e085f4cd8c76ed0c3db50f44aa893a","55fe566eccd3ebe263b4035e970a2710c7f7ea66"],"year":2009,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2d6ecfe0abb41a32f9784bbf7ac3df9177bea93f","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q45346424","https://eis.hu.edu.jo/deanshipfiles/pub103886971.pdf"],"venue":"Journal of Medical Systems","journalName":"Journal of Medical Systems","journalVolume":"35","journalPages":"463-471","doi":"10.1007/s10916-009-9382-6","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-009-9382-6","pmid":"20703544","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2008585100","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"65c36f1ed2f898e7d1797dfe90c8aa46ad415ccc","title":"Effective weighted bias fuzzy C-means in segmentation of brain MRI","paperAbstract":"Segmentation is a difficult task and challenging problem in the brain medical images for diagnosing cancer portion and other brain related diseases.

This paper introduces three new proposed algorithms namely Weighted Bias Field FCM [WBFCM], Modified bias field FCM [MBFCM] and New Approach to Bias field FCM [NBFCM] based on bias estimation and apply for segmentation of brain MRI. In general, the intensity in-homogeneities are endorsed to imperfections in the radio-frequency coils or to the problems connected with the image acquisition. The proposed methods are capable to deal the intensity in-homogeneities and more noised image effectively. We have compared our results with standard FCM and other reported methods. Further, to reduce the number of iterations, the proposed algorithms initialize the centroid using dist-max initialization algorithm before the execution of algorithm iteratively. The experimental results on brain MRI show that our methods is superior in providing better results compared to standard fuzzy c-means based algorithms.","authors":[{"name":"SR.

Normally, the doctor can evaluate their condition through an MRI scan for irregular brain tissue growth. In this research work, the Kaggle brain MRI database image is used. The boosted non-local means filter is used to reduce noise in the image acquired and to improve the quality of the proposed image technique. Identifying the exact location of the tumor is a challenge, and a novel segmentation method is proposed to evaluate the position of the tumor precisely here. Recently, the nanoscale imaging technique increases tumor detection sensitivity, accuracy, and classification into a benign situation. This segmentation activity is carried out using the nanotechnology detection system using our new region-based segmentation approach. The system suggested used for the identification of the brain tumor seed pixel in the range of nanoscale (nm) is the nanotechnology basis detection scheme. Ultimately, the 97.3% deep-neural network classification method helps to identify brain cancer by automatically extracting the function.

In addition, it is usually necessary to perform image smoothing either during image reconstruction or afterwards to achieve a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, an isotropic Gaussian filtering (GF) is used for this purpose. However, the noise suppression is at the cost of deteriorating spatial resolution. As hybrid imaging devices such as PET/MRI have become available, the complementary information derived from high definition morphologic images could be used to improve the quality of PET images. In this study, first of all, we propose an MRI-guided PET filtering method by adapting a recently proposed local linear model and then incorporate PVE into the model to get a new partial volume correction (PVC) method without parcellation of MRI. In addition, both the new filtering and PVC are voxel-wise non-iterative methods. The performance of the proposed methods were investigated with simulated dynamic FDG brain dataset and (18)F-FDG brain data of a cervical cancer patient acquired with a simultaneous hybrid PET/MR scanner. The initial simulation results demonstrated that MRI-guided PET image filtering can produce less noisy images than traditional GF and bias and coefficient of variation can be further reduced by MRI-guided PET PVC. Moreover, structures can be much better delineated in MRI-guided PET PVC for real brain data.","authors":[{"name":"Jianhua  Yan","ids":["46759043"]},{"name":"Jason Chu-Shern Lim","ids":["49719095"]},{"name":"David W Townsend","ids":["34801657"]}],"inCitations":["5b74d9dbdb34d8baed7291d4f81ba1dc46cb3c07","b53f27f671d2b06637c5bb8338aa9b9a012f5475","084bed93de16dcefd0cffbef51fa003f2c4f6aec","9017eb449c46fcef9978b4a0f569af21373597e6","8013806713205adb73530a9d2c506b33168e85dd","770b919f47185b1bfbf3f18fad2a27191a608b31","b4911db9b24b987270da8998c0220e9b13162d81","8708b29d6fabd3edf7eb73db171d48d66a709681","630efaea0944d66735d6efa6903b3bb49fa693c2","f0799c9a26bfb875e16da854ae14bd73a72325ab","9b6f975cfdaefc6df7b92c8dc74dc084ca62140b","1ec476f6d0678dfd86240728ff93f123875626ce","861c015af4f93ecdd11f923da9c770a03dd5cd91","fd44762948723b86e556b6f0804cdff12b9d8189","52a02ed6e7d2450695c006e0928978c11484e1db","940ff999bcfe40f2d5810ffe10781170c06a25da","a3b2b3908f5bfbbae9a82383fe5f3ac1abb94dc8","9370763c1492d9f82fa1afd7b2f1be2b8a28f981","5e7ccb7aa2e3b6bc8c9106f11edb40118a2c12fa","45a33316f5d6ed00345d4cd99ee2350ec7757568","5741e4a78cc39d0f18f0d8d3cee68eb5e30d63e9","340c7165e92b6eeaa94f760797fc4bcd8bfb1c91","8af5127d236f34068710b755c4f87a04a612ccdc","9968005534fdd7aa8691c306b872b8012a154dd0","ea223760795afc5b548fa89d7855a439b692ef03","5cebc290aa5123c4b9cdcbc36a6f390986ee1912","9093dd962bdf869abbcaaff6bcfd17a0d5a19a61","bd1f784bf05f89b277aa1452edcbc1d5d55ab6f5","ee9e9cfafb18a2d140b19cbb67752395abfee8ff","648df4d7a5ee89bbb1992b7d2c98b8083c34f421","fc2001d4ce0574fb70c1ab30b9ca1109fd97775c","20a3d4fe93c7f42fc3fa457460f401aca6109162","a66f1bed641cd80cae803a3f4f09640dbcbc4ef3","91b4d4c2f7e7cf1bfd11b696b584b2451a956867","49cf14b8c7a7c8e29582df4ff2762751272eedd2","43bdc30b16f6116aa7a9268aa630521b7e1580bd","7b8c2152cdcdb6a51f495b26a8ce32a42ec7f4a3","06d032db86d8f1ff85ffdb52b14af29547e3f3fc","1b925975dc53066d115e34e97205ef76cf545c2c","423713ebadc1135c5297ec2cfb8c98e0087a12f2","ca90ab303ac5bf295d9791fe2da6f389c1267107","4f6be36e26a1bb348cff4147d8bb583aa2249d3b","a2e2ba3984c2e57d13813209e70cc97dfaecf443","138e446ab7a7b7a12fab31187f44f1316ad542d9","c90fa691a314c81c8c3d32d6771f6a87bdda4466","347d2abae432092061b6c8903299d41d25a65d67","d58f4a37ab156e3f9d047bca92333c8a158c04b7","abfa52fa563a1e693675886bde3d95862eccfb88"],"outCitations":["d7ac4dfa63123e05d108a70d19bc3d682faf9ef2","ca9953001b95b4acdc0055ef6ffa445ff276464e","30a30faf89cd357ad0c0c7948b7970fe0d4a2935","649f9a5ea0c5cab9fb47cb908c7febbd4393f764","ed17352ef95b23c79509fd8d388444d7cc720d4f","69ae9073fd7f0dbfeec147a311e8754755d300ef","3b7a4fb34f80cf7ece64ea2489ae6225ee87a528","5e000a624b51f49ca11729d0b81cdd83f351effd","060e04ab5bdfa24a77484f1449a07b64db7c0873","5ec96ea4d0685819dfa7cbb253f7d79a014fb710","047daeffbba20edc1c66796b8b8dde6aeb42c4ff","339d5df12fe0599ae36bc12d4b942c1d5946bbda","eae2e0fa72e898c289365c0af16daf57a7a6cf40","48445bd1e5f966cf42860aa565daabfc39fe17e5","8401af0074f9332326b08ebe3dd5cd36ee595afc","6f5008eb780fcf4afd74504c026a8cc0733342e6","e6ba2ff060a42def9028ea4c6219e5ef7a47ee3d","bec6556106f4abf2f24bd4c585decdfed5e73d2a","a13521513fe92533309ff517314e9cad94957739","1a22c165ac68a50cc057d502991a865154197f2a","a1c22333e4039fa17dbd0167f2453b19f6e68899","17c16bf191c3502fb046005f7e8a1295edbf7f6d","fce2e704b98e0bece48ea7561d352dc284201427","8d00e1965c6bf9dc36cf1451f1332c45feebe8d0","33d04a90b8286b49300e3970c2106a6025d4053a","5ca78232e2159a9b91faacdfaa791416afd352b7","f075439c20e5b9a581d7e76454e1421201e9b555","5620050230ba1b45689cfc5e3efa064219a66a2e","c7bb49ccf15a9f8b96aef7b824ba4531b49a68d7","08fcb1656f0eef8bc721863723a0a66574a0585e","b6d6abc1a93f2ad8fb022308878ba1659d2f1510","06b4bdf13c56114996ba2b29a6a52a08b178e5fa","1b7fc36dc56a400f7a7f4c75e53550bbb6a0a4d8","c86f6a3a66b24833b9902b945488306e78ac1a57","7da8c224179f8628884259193fcab63936282a39","7a3025815fe0d7b9bafb255918fc6ed9bdefb165","d2b93dfbe50f3c642c64b8ea581cb6e449c71f82","c4f2cbddaafba030e2708bb603271ca7184fccb5","9c92237399895f6b781c48bf34f199d647ef0b68","6a0adb3daa0f01cbcfc58a771989159443165977","bfeaf424a2ea6ca4702d545c6e959e2caeb68e9b","7c5dd664e66998ec48f22bd74f24ee9033a90382"],"year":2015,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/461ace6b46aa3398f1219954b6e5e60e583a707c","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Physics in medicine and biology","journalName":"Physics in medicine and biology","journalVolume":"60 3","journalPages":"\n          961-76\n        ","doi":"10.1088/0031-9155/60/3/961","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155%2F60%2F3%2F961","pmid":"25575248","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2054591022","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"e5562b56db9c8db73305bf5868356de0252bd2ca","title":"Genetic Algorithm Based Feature Selection Brain Tumour Segmentation and Classification","paperAbstract":"Brain tumour segmentation is a significant task in the Medical Image Processing (MIP). Early diagnosis of the brain tumours plays an important role in improving treatment possibilities and maximizes the survival rate of the patients. Manual segmentation of the brain tumours for the cancer diagnosis form large amount of MRI images that generated in clinical routine, its complex and time consuming task. So, the automatic brain tumour image segmentation process is required. In this research, a tumour portion is segmented from the brain image by using Adaptively Regularized Kernel-Based Fuzzy C-Means (ARKFCM) algorithm. The input images are resized like 256×256 in the pre processing stage. The pre-processed MRI image segmented by ARKFCM, which is a flexible high-level Machine Learning (ML) technique to locate the object in a complex template. Next, Hybrid Feature Extraction (HFE) performed on the segmented image to improve the feature subsets. The feature selection process was performed by Kernel Nearest Neighbour (KNN) based Genetic Algorithm (GA) in order to acquire the best feature values. The best feature values given to the Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier as an input, which is classified into Meningioma, Glioma and Pituitary regions in the MRI images. The performance of proposed ARKFCM HFE DNN method is validated by T1-WCEMRI dataset. The experimental outcome showed that the ARKFCM HFE DNN method improved the average classification accuracy up to 6.19 % than existing classification techniques such as Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).","authors":[{"name":"Vemula  Kumar","ids":["2112124423"]},{"name":"Kodali  Krishna","ids":["145211581"]},{"name":"Sarukonda  Kusumavathi","ids":["1380884372"]}],"inCitations":["6bfd640ad36cf8605ee60a49bfee3baf5f852bf8","3aa5e40e6ea8545edb91cd35b637e9eb5b58fba0","9207dab2492e8a95fe5e024998d58aea1bf23441"],"outCitations":["e2ea87633490965e92400ae80955dcb5dce6e90a","47cd4ffd3843d6416754ca5c344ed550be039993","314530a80cddbbe5eefe9f261c5b75c4f3292cee","682d469052e913bd27f32cab76ccbfd22a32e5ce","9293ea4ddb3460c71e12a545f23b36db8a78abf1","b2cf48dea927bdb7ba83bbc158247714508c6235","0be448f70869bd71497607200d3ccc991603d0c0","ebe55760b2f89cebfb8b8f9b3abfbf139933fbec","f3f89c3e0264c4c7f8b3e8aab0b388f896fba493","4ae5e21ee2141de8da0597d452bfdf0376e03bf5","a34f6c469bcfd6a2623b6b95f4854187cef4f2cb","9ddf212367b94c80e1c57c441e66db3f5bf0104c","f15386eb7f9912cbc0cf737d7ff35f435e531ef6","8d9a62b014eceadfb4c06089380e48d89b68046d","2a2a353a99d791c8da1894a39fc7ecfbdf312e41","b01ecbf20c536a11ed3c80526b27c99a1ca12bec"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e5562b56db9c8db73305bf5868356de0252bd2ca","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.inass.org/2019/2019103121.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems","journalVolume":"12","journalPages":"214-223","doi":"10.22266/ijies2019.1031.21","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22266/ijies2019.1031.21","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2972191609","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a5f2c056768a724798f4f3cbd3ed27fba3a6993b","title":"DETECTION OF BRAIN STROKE BY MICROWAVE TOMOGRAPHY USING STRUCTURAL INVERSION AND LEARNED DICTIONARIES","paperAbstract":"Microwave tomographic imaging is an imaging modality of noninvasive reconstruction of media dielectric properties. The fact that tomographic imaging is an inexpensive technique which uses a low-energy radiation presents the advantage that it can be used as a screening method in several clinical applications, among them, the breast cancer detection and the detection of hemorrhage or stroke inside the brain. Previously, the iterative algorithm of structural inversion for breast cancer detection has been reported in [1]. It uses at each new stage of reconstruction submodels of increasing complexity. The shape-based approach with level sets offers several advantages compared to more traditional pixel-based approaches, such as well-defined boundaries and the incorporation of an intrinsic regularization, which permit to detect small lesions in breast. However, in case of brain lesion the inverse problem is much more difficult because of the scull, which causes lower penetrance of microwaves and leads to noisy data and lower resolution. At the same time, the contrast in the conductivity and permittivity values in this situation is significant due to blood higher dielectrical values compared to those of surrounding grey and white matter tissues. The authors have applied the structural reconstruction method to detect brain stroke, regarding the types of tissues composing the brain, in 2D numerical phantom created from real MRI images. The method permits to detect lesions larger than 1 cm diameter if the prior information about dielectric properties of brain tissues is used. To improve the resolution, the recently reported technique using learned dictionaries [2] for brain structure has been applied. The real MRI data from American Brain Institute database have been used to create a learned brain dictionary and the numerical phantom.","authors":[{"name":"Natalia  Irishina","ids":["2933521"]},{"name":"Aurora  Torrente","ids":["32094020"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["e087876badcb0f3fae5ef7d402904885f2cc8851","a1a15d1787c8402c632d6ebab3b407aaea78268e"],"year":2010,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a5f2c056768a724798f4f3cbd3ed27fba3a6993b","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://jornadas.imm.upv.es/2012/Abstracts/MedIrishina.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2186614167","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"9f2be0ed4b1496f312aaf87f52959e5a17d47bfc","title":"A Brain Tumor Segmentation Framework Based on Outlier Detection Using One-Class Support Vector Machine","paperAbstract":"Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is a challenging task and also a crucial step in diagnosis and treatment planning for cancer patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard imaging modality for detection, characterization, treatment planning and outcome evaluation of brain tumors. MRI scans are usually acquired at multiple sessions before and after the treatment. An automatic segmentation framework is highly desirable to segment brain tumors in MR images as it streamlines the image-guided radiation therapy workflow considerably. Automatic segmentation of brain tumors also facilitates an incremental development of data-driven systems for therapy outcome prediction based on radiomics analysis. In this study, an outlier-detection-based segmentation framework is proposed to delineate brain tumors in magnetic resonance (MR) images automatically. The proposed method considers the tumor and edema pixels in an MR image as outliers compared to the pixels associated with the healthy tissue. The framework generates two outlier masks using independent one-class support vector machines that operate on post-contrast T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted-fluid-attenuation-inversion-recovery (T2-FLAIR) images. The outlier masks are subsequently refined and fused using a number of morphological and logical operators to estimate a tumor mask for each image slice. The framework was constructed and evaluated using the MRI data acquired from 35 and 5 patients with brain metastasis, respectively. The obtained results demonstrated an average Dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance of 0.84 ± 0.06 and 1.85 ± 0.48 mm, respectively, between the manual (ground truth) and automatic tumor contours, on the independent test set.","authors":[{"name":"Ali  Jalalifar","ids":["1412000455"]},{"name":"Hany  Soliman","ids":["2999318"]},{"name":"Mark  Ruschin","ids":["2506152"]},{"name":"Arjun  Sahgal","ids":["2539518"]},{"name":"Ali  Sadeghi-Naini","ids":["1397756283"]}],"inCitations":["7646cdbb429ff5e733d84ed1b9059e4a8e116d91","e309d8cf5c011a8c15e08d6082dc0dab804114aa"],"outCitations":["044bfd29b362700b00d985aa2181e80b4e3bcbec","7259a96b1130378f4290991cb24638a05b4dab25","078d7045ee16c8e86603a6c19a78be7a83e8e40d","eaaa7cba288b5cd7397722ae4bc37995ae6c3788","7b55675815873cdc3a306d40bdc9e7243a217b0f","84f2a000ec32f9394ca6cd823c5cf724be9b5a9b","b98957f4f0716e5cf88ea278e31784d788761abe","00506b5142f13000a8849273f1aca9f33f39c38c","af711d6f170ee2fa1859050dd257f48adc71c45c","a6133261507af708881817166842d62b67ddff36","52b7bf3ba59b31f362aa07f957f1543a29a4279e","84cf3ba4269fcd4033bc096151285bf68e41c73d","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","73a50f51a65826e573fa966cb9a1e3126023f2f1","32da7e379f84ccb8c6ece0bf4d6c83b6a10ba29f","e75d4883b920935b45fc5a46a7b48b341357bc70","8f89cc8b8934995ee37ed987cce90f57504343ce","12ee25d367ed46f6db4f6423afb322c95fbdda85","f773387860910f0082c4161c612a7702802d67b1","dcd99d49af33bd14e9e0750bcf854e7b306c808a","bf206bad6a74d27b40c8ea77ee54e98e492fb7f9","90347d030ade65bb5234530671da489988828efe"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9f2be0ed4b1496f312aaf87f52959e5a17d47bfc","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q100447364"],"venue":"2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","journalName":"2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1067-1070","doi":"10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176263","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176263","pmid":"33018170","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"3082571599","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"ad8ca90b41ff214baf539d4511c7261176eac9ca","title":"Detection of brain tumors from MRI images base on deep learning using hybrid model CNN and NADE","paperAbstract":"Abstract A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells inside the skull. Malignant brain tumors are among the most dreadful types of cancer with direct consequences such as cognitive decline and poor quality of life. Analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a popular technique for brain tumor detection. In this paper, we use these images to train our new hybrid paradigm which consists of a neural autoregressive distribution estimation (NADE) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). We subsequently test this model with 3064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images with three types of brain tumors. The results demonstrate that the hybrid CNN-NADE has a high classification performance as regards the availability of medical images are limited.","authors":[{"name":"Raheleh  Hashemzehi","ids":["72136201"]},{"name":"Seyyed Javad Seyyed Mahdavi","ids":["2001408"]},{"name":"Maryam Asadollahi Kheirabadi","ids":["88102263"]},{"name":"Seyed Reza Kamel","ids":["2096167"]}],"inCitations":["61f577c71e725b57665411128ad1ff5b11dfef7f","519cb6dbefe9802cfab16dee7a89cd82db2f654f","c3c26d9b88b6005ac19b79c0180b31b4aaec60c2","5b6b9b9f9bc6c68bcc87f6c58c61e5984b5f3dee","f1f6ed7cf1b3441c66e9c105bdaa0e4a70c10289","5a43001aeb98de521bcf1cce902e384094d26895","d0efd261e12c316a0a4f50c2f673af04a04b6200","23cd1b25e5dd4dc55cb9e6d19eb8e652f81038a7","b58f734c605d0ea3060420c93cfa35ec26b437b9","b5d64744014e8503cdea7395bd2190127cc4d526"],"outCitations":["6718ed5f9267960034155faa709e24988eb89fcc","5144bcaa63716c16e96b7299f366977d7faad994","d981033f963802ad4ede29842b58b498380c3562","e2e4df0c70d36ac1a40d8861278263719379072e","696f4757994d13352b5b934d3c1a18dfabb71d1c","4bd3d1518623fd478a0c61c69f9efd11b9b301c3","a8e8f3c8d4418c8d62e306538c9c1292635e9d27","2a505f76fa02e3367c8e57e7a7d4d7c0aeefa82d","020018f11ca2ad64738ed40bae8c312e3db2b320","25f8ff40222554b8f553095464ba1a5810ea4d78","b0d1b50cf33671445713057985fce07736a29487","abab3b1a2e771350433745bbda2b0e8f286aa65f","4df6d7a0cbb230a446589dcb65ea0b09446b15b7","14ab9fe14d9d7ac9f60b2a4dbaa2f4ca6c77ce20","a4cec122a08216fe8a3bc19b22e78fbaea096256","c7194d8950ac11b4120d623f7c26b0f89a03e62d","79461362af5899a45b420993af9ad9025dc6aedf","70d02e3ee6a2537ea4d5982fa4830774737cff46","aeee98c90799cd44dde4046754cff27c8ed28d44","7580c72df96488927c59a5f31a4b10784adfc749","03d67da60612e60692b0bfdac1eedadc0a98905d","2480845a2353baa6d4b060e9d8341d61983f91d6","d6f12feb4fd99244286910576eb7c94ff10ef4b3","61d2e5ab597ae57d12c27613315a441d184e64af","7c2bcf6f32b05a04cd3444c030db743e5666af88","06dfe0207cc4625c115ea1dc55145cde1c7034c0","90f72fbbe5f0a29e627db28999e01a30a9655bc6","f06a12928307e17b1aff2b9f4a6c11791f19b6a7","93d8139ee04646b87a094b12de3782830e8b7735","ba6961160c10bab1b37b89dbee65d91133ba4acf","1a6b7243455dff0db201f11d1cb64d3b1db4ebb4","bd5d67bc40ec7ee6bad6c6ca045028533bf6647c","2b3e698ca5ad0ae633bc65312c46434ccbad43f2","124c2c5dd7b653fcfaaeb568e1b9034351f36a71","c83a3c6214571b75cc3c4321ac7c4d63820456d3","0936352b78a52bc5d2b5e3f04233efc56664af51","69e68bfaadf2dccff800158749f5a50fe82d173b","3cccc93064dae265eeb7bc76d02cdc67c942f0a5","c5f5311fa1f34159ab3a0a1d58da51cd0340a640","e57894dccd38fcab17ec57d21b4a05dfa33b48b1"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ad8ca90b41ff214baf539d4511c7261176eac9ca","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering","journalVolume":"40","journalPages":"1225-1232","doi":"10.1016/j.bbe.2020.06.001","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbe.2020.06.001","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3034970121","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"dc224ac19cd7c19a999e143045fb6aa9b470ba51","title":"Multivoxel MR Spectroscopy Tool for Brain Cancer Detection in Neuronavigation - Performance","paperAbstract":"This work presents a simple and interactive spectroscopic tool to help clinicians for brain cancer detection.

In particular, we focus on the segmentation of the human brain and related stru ctures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We present three novel probabilis tic methods from the field of database-guided knowledge-based medical image segment ation. We apply each of our methods to one of three MRI segmentation scenarios: 1) 3-D MRI b rain tissue classification and intensity non-uniformity correction, 2) pediat ric brain cancer segmentation in multi-spectral 3-D MRI, and 3) 3-D MRI anatomical brain struct ure segmentation. All the newly developed methods make use of domain knowledge enc od d by probabilistic boosting-trees (PBT), which is a recent machine learning tec hnique. For all the methods we present uniform probabilistic formalisms that group the methods into the broader context of probabilistic modeling for the purpose of image s egmentation. We show by comparison with other methods from the literature that in al l the scenarios our newly developed algorithms in most cases give more accurate results and have a lower computational cost. Evaluation on publicly available benchmarking data s ets ensures reliable comparability of our results to those of other current and future met hods.

A cerebrum tumor is the gathering of an unnecessary and unusual development of the cell in the brain. A brain cancer is the reason of the death among children and adults. A brain tumor is an addition of cells that grows out of control of the common forces that increases. Consistently more than 2 lack people in the United States have analyzed medical image processing has been quickly developing and testing field in the current decades. A cerebrum tumor is a genuine life weakening disease with an unnecessary or auxiliary brain cancer [18]. Brain cancer stays a standout along with the most severe types of tumor, with a normal survival time of one to two years. The cancer might be essential or auxiliary. Kind is the essential cerebrum tumor and threatening is the optional brain tumor. Essential brain tumor (the tumor created in the cerebrum). A malignant tumor is riskier. A malignant brain tumor extends in other brain tissues. Brain tumor partition is still a challenging task for the uncertain appearance and shape of the brain tumor. In our approach, detection of Brain cancer utilizing k-means partition that comprises of a system from a morphological operation, Segmentation, and Detection with object labeling algorithm as its final tumor area. The authors have to present basics of image processing. Our main purpose is to identify the cancer from MRI Images. Author proposing another system for position of cerebrum tumor utilizing segmentation based on object labeling algorithm. In many past papers utilized object labeling algorithm, it gives a good result for object detection so we combine two methods k-means and object labeling for tumor detection. Processing techniques involve five stages namely Image Pre-Processing, Morphological opening, Image Segmentation and Object labeling algorithm.","authors":[{"name":"Vidya  Dhanve","ids":["50843809"]},{"name":"Meeta  Kumar","ids":["38201246"]}],"inCitations":["8206f7a6aadbaaffdfebb2529dee12e6275db34d","fc8196b139bbec02e5aa7bfb625499cc9b70fd0f","d6a3e301d7df2880fc8f6c74d660e4348a398ff0","3bc93157db199e20dea33e1efe0c3589377945a4"],"outCitations":["51569d2bf7536af52dccaa68fe5c093cf4b58d8a","0be448f70869bd71497607200d3ccc991603d0c0","8f709b72c89648bbeb239e83bff36616397c3088","7f8f68a3b48b9db4ae3234c3b81dde404a4af1be","eab1540a465b06d242c67facf18d9062183d7044","64698a156963ef7e36424b1c46bedaeb74a952ea","8e80642f07e004a79f76aaf355e4952444f3ffb5","8ad026c6d26714b6fe32c7ad6a4485b7c55b10d5","d92093fe7d2df8aa27fb07f22be4cc848db4023c","05df3a8f7bc3fbb626af67c96ceca4c1134f65ff","a9197b306fe9fac4f02716ce3eeab4e84b224b80","4bb64e76b9b5087444eece4041f68001eb301e96","7da5c56244847c9c16f9e68915bbe52486a620b4","98d764393a27a87acceab45c5832c9cc6fdfbc79","386afaf00433ebd37cc4a93f2a4231885425729f","c26cae6ee3901befcf7431e1d64be6c26729d1a7","f9fa30e0331c8d948c883a5217e0f82ea6a6e130","dc8970b9d74f2720a4bdc64c341b3b13a1665621"],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa0192c54c975c07131a5ef8920550deacb1352e","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Power, Control, Signals and Instrumentation Engineering (ICPCSI)","journalName":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Power, Control, Signals and Instrumentation Engineering (ICPCSI)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"944-951","doi":"10.1109/ICPCSI.2017.8391851","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPCSI.2017.8391851","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2810884605","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"d1dc0f5471f2485880ea81b052fab8a0a810b7a0","title":"A Hybrid CNN-SVM Threshold Segmentation Approach for Tumor Detection and Classification of MRI Brain Images","paperAbstract":"Abstract Objective In this research paper, the brain MRI images are going to classify by considering the excellence of CNN on a public dataset to classify Benign and Malignant tumors. Materials and Methods Deep learning (DL) methods due to good performance in the last few years have become more popular for Image classification. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), with several methods, can extract features without using handcrafted models, and eventually, show better accuracy of classification. The proposed hybrid model combined CNN and support vector machine (SVM) in terms of classification and with threshold-based segmentation in terms of detection. Result The findings of previous studies are based on different models with their accuracy as Rough Extreme Learning Machine (RELM)-94.233%, Deep CNN (DCNN)-95%, Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Discrete Wavelet Autoencoder (DWA)-96%, k-nearest neighbors (kNN)-96.6%, CNN-97.5%. The overall accuracy of the hybrid CNN-SVM is obtained as 98.4959%. Conclusion In today's world, brain cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases with the highest death rate, detection and classification of brain tumors due to abnormal growth of cells, shapes, orientation, and the location is a challengeable task in medical imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a typical method of medical imaging for brain tumor analysis. Conventional machine learning (ML) techniques categorize brain cancer based on some handicraft property with the radiologist specialist choice. That can lead to failure in the execution and also decrease the effectiveness of an Algorithm.

Computer aided detection of abnormality in medical images is primarily motivated by the necessity of achieving maximum possible accuracy. There are lots of methods for automatic and semi- automatic image classification, though most of them fail because of unknown noise, poor image contrast, inhomogeneity and boundaries that are usual in medical images. The MRI (Magnetic resonance Imaging) brain tumor segmentation is a complicated task due to the variance and intricacy of tumors. The principle aim of the project is to perform the MRI Brain image classification of cancer, based on Rough Set Theory and Feed Forward Neural Network classifier. For this purpose, first the features are extracted from the input MRI images using Rough set theory, and then the selected features are given as input to Feed Forward Neural Network classifier. Finally, Feed Forward Neural Network classifier is utilized to perform two functions. The first is to differentiate between normal and abnormal. The second function is to classify the type of abnormality in benign or malignant tumor.","authors":[{"name":"T.  Rajesh","ids":["145207523"]},{"name":"R.

However, to determine the final image, the entire frequency information is not needed. To decrease the size of the frequency domain in a relatively large k-space, and to produce an MRI image of a brain, data was gathered in certain ways by utilizing various filters. Through utilizing MRI filters based on proposed Gaussian filters such as y = exp(-((m-L/2)2)/ck), where m, L, c and k are all variables, and by adjusting the two main variables, c and k; relatively clear images with smaller k-space are able to be created.

It is the subsequent reason for tumor related deaths in adults under the age 20-39. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is assuming a significant job in the examination of neuroscience for contemplating brain images. The investigation of brain MRI Images is useful in brain tumor analysis process. Features will be extricated and selected from the segmented pictures and afterward grouped by utilizing the classification procedures to analyze whether the patient is ordinary (having no tumor) or irregular (having tumor). One of the most dangerous cancers is brain tumor or cancer which affects the human body's main nervous system. Infection that can affect is very sensitive to the brain. Two types of brain tumors are present. The tumor may be categorized as benign and malignant. The benign tumor represents a change in the shape and structure of the cells, but cannot contaminate or spread to other cells in the brain. The malignant tumor can spread and grow if not carefully treated and removed. The detection of brain tumors is a difficult and sensitive task involving the classifier's experience. In the proposed work a Group based Classifier for Brain Tumor Recognition (GbCBTD) is introduced for the efficient segmentation of MRI images and for identification of tumor. The use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system to classify the brain tumor type is presented in this work. Relevant features are extracted from images and by using CNN with machine learning technique, tumor can be recognized. CNN can reduce the cost and increase the performance of brain tumor detection. The proposed work is compared to the traditional methods and the results show that the proposed method is effective in detecting tumors.","authors":[{"name":"Putta Rama Krishnaveni","ids":["2038115655"]},{"name":"Gattim Naveen Kishore","ids":["2035785020"]}],"inCitations":["ee65b78f56d22ac0ab8ce55c80a0ac13283c36de"],"outCitations":["93515e096dfe1df762f3567a251b12a463c5fb90","4bbdff1b07d029538a54edf89d1507c6bcb72498","83cd5b3b07d4186ae6eab74ec8346ac711123cab","9c0e9f5745a65beab9cf27fb1be567f8ab937e98","cd2c50795af044250a20df7bfc24635b426f7a33","306b3d24b2147b55e048ad733f5b8556b0b7204e","21c2bc08e95c64d02d12283947f31dd717b8e3c2","2984e527510e7e7c0eadb339a6172c05a6919b5e","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","fbbd3381640dae2ca4b03ac7ed85bfec896929b8","8e2091f4c9ee8aa58a6d653ab32ff3a80f1625a0","4e607b44337fe7160cb4f4ce153332c7e53964a7","024ee1cbba7d9f1aac27e4e694bd08278dccb410","737fee7516fdd6767a4d5216ba7c23b51758404d","c5d8e1fd572e2b9f14e2680340be22f587e022ce","68a0592bbca7e6ac97105b00a11fca50172675d8","f6d28c8674f546895ce79cabf16f7f8dabac99db","f2d1e962ab79d7690072c3919ce543101fc0a62a","2bfbaa16706bd4e0d2a4e19dde87e7c2a0400f55","160742f8a787878dc85595484d2e48378016b4b0","ef22d31994b049104a8177d239e874b3699117ca","eb3d05791de45788dd7e92b51ca8265cf3cdbc72","6416f74798aaedb1ea27321a1fd9f42be71a7ac4","8440797be1186d2afa05ae3f1c66d41d80283c13"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ef5496d04a5fae94f64a6f54b73cb0f1ae92fc21","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.18280/ts.370520","http://www.iieta.org/download/file/fid/44644"],"venue":"Traitement du Signal","journalName":"Traitement du Signal","journalVolume":"37","journalPages":"865-871","doi":"10.18280/ts.370520","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18280/ts.370520","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3112503055","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"fec9b85fe45bfdfe03419cf8b421b46db7023eaf","title":"Investigation on Abnormal Tissues Detection Methods for MRI Image","paperAbstract":"Abstract Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed information about the soft tissues of the brain to identify tumors, cancer or any abnormal conditions in brain. Usually these images contain a significant amount of noise caused by operators or some external factors. De-noising is essential before detection of any abnormal areas from these images. There are several de-noising methods. In this paper, wavelet denoising techniques are considered for denoising the MRI image. The quality of the image is assessed using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Squared Error Mean (SEM) and Absolute Mean Error (AME). These de-noised images are very useful for the segmentation process to easily extract the abnormal area from the image. Segmentation plays a crucial role for detection of any abnormal areas, tumors and irregularities in brain images. For this process two unsupervised algorithms are proposed for the detection of abnormal area from de-noised image. Both Expectation Maximization and K-means segmentation algorithims are used to identify the abnormal tissues in a given MRI. The performance of both methods are analyzed with suitable parameters like Entropy, Area and Perimeter. These parameters show the performance of the algorithms for the segmentation process and hence a suitable algorithm can be applied.","authors":[{"name":"V.  Sowjanya","ids":["13129693"]},{"name":"G.

Various technological advances have made major contributions in imaging, including intraoperative magnetic imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). However, these technologies have pros and cons in providing quantitative, real-time and three-dimensional (3D) continuous guidance in brain cancer detection. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive, label-free, cost-effective technique capable of imaging tissue in three dimensions and real time. The purpose of this study is to reliably and efficiently discriminate between non-cancer and cancer-infiltrated brain regions using OCT images. To this end, a mathematical model for quantitative evaluation known as the Blind End- Member and Abundances Extraction method (BEAE). This BEAE method is a constrained optimization technique which extracts spatial information from volumetric OCT images. Using this novel method, we are able to discriminate between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues and using logistic regression as a classifier for automatic brain tumor margin detection. Using this technique, we are able to achieve excellent performance using an extensive cross-validation of the training dataset (sensitivity 92.91% and specificity 98.15%) and again using an independent, blinded validation dataset (sensitivity 92.91% and specificity 86.36%). In summary, BEAE is well-suited to differentiate brain tissue which could support the guiding surgery process for tissue resection.","authors":[{"name":"Ronald M.

The segmented model was manufactured in a 3-D printer using (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) ABS plastic. The cerebral tissue was mimicked by an agar-evaporated milk-silica gel (2% w/v-25% v/v-1.2% w/v) which was molded inside a skull model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe measured attenuation of the ABS skull was 16 dB/cm MHz. The estimated attenuation coefficient of the gel replicating brain tissue was 0.6 dB/cm MHz. The estimated agar-silica gel's T1 and T2 relaxation times in a 1.5 Tesla magnetic field were 852 ms and 66 ms respectively. The effectiveness of the skull to reduce ultrasonic heating was demonstrated using MRI thermometry.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDue to growing interest in using MRI guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) for treating brain cancer and its application in sonothrombolysis, the proposed head phantom can be utilized as a very useful tool for evaluating ultrasonic protocols, thus minimizing the need for animal models and cadavers.","authors":[{"name":"Georgios  Menikou","ids":["15007182"]},{"name":"Tetiana  Dadakova","ids":["6876224"]},{"name":"Matt  Pavlina","ids":["46561137"]},{"name":"Michael

synthesis","paperAbstract":"Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging modality for patient dose calculation for radiation therapy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) is used along with CT to identify brain structures due to its superior soft tissue contrast. Registration of MR and CT is necessary for accurate delineation of the tumor and other structures, and is critical in radiotherapy planning. Mutual information (MI) or its variants are typically used as a similarity metric to register MRI to CT. However, unlike CT, MRI intensity does not have an accepted calibrated intensity scale. Therefore, MI-based MR-CT registration may vary from scan to scan as MI depends on the joint histogram of the images. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic framework for MR-CT registration by synthesizing a synthetic CT image from MRI using a co-registered pair of MR and CT images as an atlas. Patches of the subject MRI are matched to the atlas and the synthetic CT patches are estimated in a probabilistic framework. The synthetic CT is registered to the original CT using a deformable registration and the computed deformation is applied to the MRI. In contrast to most existing methods, we do not need any manual intervention such as picking landmarks or regions of interests. The proposed method was validated on ten brain cancer patient cases, showing 25% improvement in MI and correlation between MR and CT images after registration compared to state-of-the-art registration methods.","authors":[{"name":"Snehashis  Roy","ids":["1753443"]},{"name":"Aaron  Carass","ids":["1755681"]},{"name":"Amod  Jog","ids":["1880139"]},{"name":"Jerry L.

Nanoparticles, which selectively accumulate in tumor tissue due to their leaky vasculature and the enhanced permeability and retention effect, have shown promise as both therapeutic and diagnostic agents for brain tumors. In particular, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been leveraged as T2-weighted MRI contrast agents for tumor detection and imaging; and gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have been demonstrated as radiosensitizers capable of propagating electron and free radical-induced radiation damage to tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the potential applications of novel gold and SPION-loaded micelles (GSMs) coated by polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone (PEG-PCL) polymer. By quantifying gh2ax DNA damage foci in glioblastoma cell lines, we tested the radiosensitizing efficacy of these GSMs, and found that GSM administration in conjunction with radiation therapy (RT) led to ~2-fold increase in density of double-stranded DNA breaks. For imaging, we used GSMs as a contrast agent for both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of stereotactically implanted GBM tumors in a mouse model, and found that MRI but not CT was sufficiently sensitive to detect and delineate tumor borders after administration and accumulation of GSMs. These results suggest that with further development and testing, GSMs may potentially be integrated into both imaging and treatment of brain tumors, serving a theranostic purpose as both an MRI-based contrast agent and a radiosensitizer.","authors":[{"name":"Lova  Sun","ids":["48243625"]},{"name":"Daniel Y Joh","ids":["3326207"]},{"name":"Ajlan  Al-Zaki","ids":["1401690451"]},{"name":"Melissa  Stangl","ids":["34245038"]},{"name":"Surya  Murty","ids":["123711085"]},{"name":"James J Davis","ids":["48058967"]},{"name":"Brian C Baumann","ids":["4854369"]},{"name":"Michelle  Alonso-Basanta","ids":["1401409513"]},{"name":"Gary D Kaol","ids":["12993071"]},{"name":"Andrew  Tsourkas","ids":["3055748"]},{"name":"Jay F Dorsey","ids":["3117734"]}],"inCitations":["fa399e3c1e951603512f7bec11d5f3b126ec99bc","2bbb630204029eff449a4c9c95f020bba3cd1ccf","4d6b1f9fbc242c066974507db9e34e841ff0ec60","7a04897f171145f7ded1b3961a78241d6af64354","c69655f1b07113747e3580cc8ff5345e3ee33364","57a12db034b6bb492a7cf1396e9abff1f6179c9c","08730aeab01c09806875151b6a8cb94ca6add302","f2d42864d55e4aa1f913a62e375ca224679008c5","f3001a5fdbf2c70ee0f4e09d49cd0ec61d259064","2054cd38a4a6d35636b33d10c664328725ae5f34","06b8159b85926411d819712f8c1af0632857f164","b067e50a8d7e57d860052c70203936f377b997b0","30fb0ad9c8ebc9f47d1b450a8a974714a32e26ae","028338062de19d7aba2d37ac145afe88dfa75a4b","7d16763b76b3b7383bbea43b24337e9e2017c59d","71bcbe9ea83959ec04ec66d4e2f9944049fb288e","a27da56d2d85115897aecf9a4e9d318d8cc7a59f","912b3a447d8e439f6a70d2f33738f32a754359a4","80f1835d36fd0edf17d22f5413d3e21dc63e5a83","bbc634ca50d7e700fc6901c41a6b8b2537873e64","13f4c659ef676394130e7766f2729338383fda75","ea8e01b25ede7141edc47e3dbeb7449e06954b6e","59df6efc614674845c00b636037fcb6c136ef232","7ed9a61eb5c809098a728a91d21de0cdfac9688b","6b89795e562554a72d64d776bf0b50b9029ca1b5","a1600a31dea65046cf559b33e29faad05009ac5b","f9c55d1154ff6bd6586f1b38208fcaa9bb476764","38b23dc302c8676fa07a57423d7ccad096ce6fc4","861c0238bf951d0820a1478a2a25660d919ed82a","37ce065bb74401f3be5021a8c33dfa98ed7d13e1","f8e0ab83b860e41f905a76b73595f0a8511ec551","4949294271158318b0ac101330bfd6f2f67fd67e","52ba05cb07f89277eb512d9c7096e60cd6212151","6a9ae870d84fbf10049ee09ab944cb0ec79b0069","9551d1632a7c250452c7111fe0a3623a8a4e8e52","643554d52d29a9fad17145f8ac81b848da9a3eea","001b432af95fd64271d3ff6755bb7df2555af177","20ce1036071ca83efd68c550f87768c2b9d3c5d7","ffdbfcaa118fd25f422134be0a3ca9be504a7b86","f2b6ce8675b945f523a2a64160044d7a86872e9e","26217b5f563fcbb39e9bee1b5c527f98e548117f","4cdaa7c2858ce3bd0c6a5049ca7cbfa90894bc96","53e3446d08490232a309ca5f7b30dc4079885643","f3d89a675287bb1f59036b9c7d1297f6dcac2dff","be568041b9cfe955aa8ea1607597d41174f52ec3","406b444e4f28ab3c5d15382159beb6d0f4b3576e","01bac53edd964fcbc6d72d68ce3a0807736d90f6","592af0c80f2c3c789f732dcdb905fc09e34352be","c788b7ee5edd3e7a69ae9a05b73988d4210ba09a","4571e355389c155cd99ddf12b52dd73c1c9eccc0","a4ad418aa884e7db0af23f15a46e3eab5fd142e6","e09f4c1c4dcf5f0a56304be49889537923eca44c","abea8d0ffda5f727bbb6807af0257d9ea288a23b"],"outCitations":[],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f6cf17395fc9e3b7b3dea09ae17ffeb15f5d2d06","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Journal of biomedical nanotechnology","journalName":"Journal of biomedical nanotechnology","journalVolume":"12 2","journalPages":"\n          347-56\n        ","doi":"10.1166/JBN.2016.2173","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1166/JBN.2016.2173","pmid":"27305768","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Materials Science"],"magId":"2424728169","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"7a3794d3c79f2427a613a046dd1213be241cbdcc","title":"An Efficient Image Processing Technique for Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor, a type of cancer, is caused by a genetic mutation of abnormal neuronal cells. However, it cannot be easily diagnosed and depends on the patient’s symptoms which range from hemialgia, seizure, irregular vision, mental shift and many more. The symptoms may vary depending on the region of the tumor. Currently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is the foremost means for tumor detection as well as identifying the position and extent of the tumor for surgical procedure. However, the MRIs are needed to be manually checked by a professional to determine the results. We propose a system which is an effective image processing algorithm for detecting and recognizing the tumor from MRI images to obtain the image segmentation of brain bleeding more accurately, making immediate medical treatment possible. In this system, the same problem with different procedures and methods is tested to find the best conjunction through trial and error. Through the combination, the effectiveness and error ratio of the results is engrossed on. This approach is for early detection of brain tumors with high correctness which gives an adequate result by detecting brain tumor properly.","authors":[{"name":"Sadia  Alam","ids":["1860793433"]},{"name":"Md.

It is essential to have a short delay and high accuracy in diagnostic of fast spreading cancerous cells. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the important means in cancer diagnosis. In this context, various Super-Resolution (SR) methods have been proposed for the use in MRI scans after acquisition time. In this paper, an adaptive super-resolution algorithm is presented which can detect MRI scans defects and try to reconstruct them. As a consequence, the proposed SR algorithm may increase sensitivity and specificity of the output results. One of the important advantage of the proposed algorithm is its ability to maintain the specifications without any changs in significant part of the data. Thus, the proposed method can be emplyed in MRI for better results in real-time in terms of sensitivity and accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"Kian  Jafari","ids":["116447208"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["1daf097a6e54b0154d50649a35a5c78371b0c11d","c1ff14262d5d4871bf28c3e4e3ec25cce3bd5980","33cadd88d8fe2bb7b690eece03af13d0623befe0","eb1f22b03e249be65a5eb493cd66f62fc85fc9da","69619639ca0f3db38aee85fc9f37d84f589d30c7","da20a8b34887168cc9a813782bf56bf6694a5dc7","c6053a7548ef48d2b3b4112ceb7c6b2d4f1fb4ea","82590f30e16e2ab9579880a980ffafccce557b21","72ce0faa2d0be574f5cb88cfe6353a3ba40a08ae","f99d0bd1f1288fe35d46f719125844bfbaf544e3","e093c3c715e0ac6f6a3a21e895d4e80c27013376"],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e9dd3b573522381e7eab9a9e651e7fd5b20af457","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://popups.uliege.be/0037-9565/index.php?file=1&id=5270"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2460563929","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"c35dde49efe784959b84ee452610186c1b1c0816","title":"Peptide-conjugated polyamidoamine dendrimer as a nanoscale tumor-targeted T1 magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent.","paperAbstract":"A tumor-targeting carrier, peptide HAIYPRH (T7)-conjugated polyethylene glycol-modified polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM-PEG-T7) was explored to deliver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents targeting to the tumor cells specifically. Two different types of tumors, liver cancer and early brain glioma model (involved with the blood-brain barrier), were chosen to evaluate the imaging capacity of this contrast agent. PAMAM-PEG-T7 was synthesized, conjugated with diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and further chelated gadolinium (Gd), yielding GdDTPA-PAMAM-PEG-T7. The result of ICP-AES showed that about 92 Gd ions could be loaded per PAMAM molecule. The calculated longitudinal relaxivity R1 of the GdDTPA-PAMAM-PEG-T7 was 10.7 mm(-1) S(-1) per Gd (984.4 mm(-1) S(-1) per PAMAM), while that of GdDTPA was only 4.8 mm(-1) S(-1). PAMAM-PEG-T7 had better targeting capacity to the liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, compared with PAMAM-PEG. The accumulation of PAMAM-PEG-T7 was 162.5% times that of PAMAM-PEG. But for glioma cells, PAMAM-PEG-T7 did not show its specificity. Furthermore, GdDTPA-PAMAM-PEG-T7 could improve the diagnostic efficiency of liver cancer with the enhanced signal (187%), compared to 130% for PAMAM-PEG and 121% for GdDTPA. GdDTPA-PAMAM-PEG-T7 could selectively identify liver cancer but not early glioma. This nanoscaled MRI contrast agent GdDTPA-PAMAM-PEG-T7 might allow for selective and efficient diagnosis of tumors without the natural barrier including liver cancer.","authors":[{"name":"Liang

characterize Tumor Field Effect: Application to Survival Prediction in Glioblastoma","paperAbstract":"The concept of tumor field effect implies that cancer is a systemic disease with its impact way beyond the visible tumor confines. For instance, in Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor, the increase in intracranial pressure due to tumor burden often leads to brain herniation and poor outcomes. Our work is based on the rationale that highly aggressive tumors tend to grow uncontrollably, leading to pronounced biomechanical tissue deformations in the normal parenchyma, which when combined with local morphological differences in the tumor confines on MRI scans, will comprehensively capture tumor field effect. Specifically, we present an integrated MRI-based descriptor, radiomic-Deformation and Textural Heterogeneity (rDepTH). This descriptor comprises measurements of the subtle perturbations in tissue deformations throughout the surrounding This work was funded by the NIH awards 1U24CA19937401, R01CA202752-01A1, R01CA208236-01A1, R01CA21657901A1, R01CA220581-01A1, 1U01CA239055-01, 1U01CA248226-01, 1U54CA254566-01, 1P20CA233216-01; National Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering 1R43EB028736-01; National Center for Research Resources under award number 1C06RR12463-01; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 1R01HL15127701A1; VA Merit Review Award IBX004121A from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Service; the DOD Prostate Cancer Idea Development Award (W81XWH-15-1-0558); the DOD Lung Cancer Investigator-Initiated Translational Research Award (W81XWH-18-1-0440); the DOD Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program (W81XWH-16-1-0329); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (1K25 DK115904-01A1); the Ohio Third Frontier Technology Validation Fund; the Wallace H.

This involves nonrigidly aligning the patients’ MRI scans to a healthy atlas via diffeomorphic registration. The resulting inverse mapping is used to obtain the deformation field magnitudes in the normal parenchyma. These measurements are then combined with a 3D texture descriptor, Co-occurrence of Local Anisotropic Gradient Orientations (COLLAGE), which captures the morphological heterogeneity within the tumor confines, on MRI scans. RDepTH, on N = 207 GBM cases (training set (St) = 128, testing set (Sv) = 79), demonstrated improved prognosis of overall survival by categorizing patients into low(prolonged survival) and high-risk (poor survival) groups (on St, p-value = 3.5×10−7, and on Sv , p-value = 0.0024). R-DepTH descriptor may serve as a comprehensive MRI-based prognostic marker of disease aggressiveness and survival in solid tumors.","authors":[{"name":"Marwa  Ismail","ids":["40638179"]},{"name":"Prateek  Prasanna","ids":["39017169"]},{"name":"Kaustav  Bera","ids":["46459416"]},{"name":"Volodymyr  Statsevych","ids":["40811058"]},{"name":"Virginia  Hill","ids":["145359908"]},{"name":"Gagandeep  Singh","ids":["1452128653"]},{"name":"Sasan  Partovi","ids":["2565343"]},{"name":"Niha  Beig","ids":["14027104"]},{"name":"Sean  McGarry","ids":["40074839"]},{"name":"Peter  Laviolette","ids":["1997540"]},{"name":"Manmeet  Ahluwalia","ids":["144946154"]},{"name":"Anant  Madabhushi","ids":["1705442"]},{"name":"Pallavi  Tiwari","ids":["2344884"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["4eacd59b8e1255656f21496f9704ec15635acb9e","88d8040019f01c6cb1b064194585327654035432","d4c9f89ee858374a81cbf08cded6fd8a4d1b0719","ac9c274117a3c10d89772ebd66446c3c225ccf2c","1ed51bc8dddfe8c9ad161942e1f7e329f3cc1f47","72c076024e6ee51866f0dcad1d21bfe6ea14632b","e12de327e241d104291fd1ce770955571dd907cb","5255e2426be6a31e33a31044f7c39342f26e41d1","7a015c4acdeab85b1d754e6e16303fbae8e04b09","0b0400bd1c2b9ba65080534f09d34949a6cf6f14","900759079e7d749d9dd26fa600add77bd063c534","517f76c5c0c8dd5837d61a34be435f1ae6904931","8bf8fff0c0867a9a6235e3f1dfe713116f83e0ad","6159cc2b596bd8f9afacb8df32d3bb62a3b49d69","6a80790f547502d6aed41a788b4870aad219a4a6","4d766af2687d3603a9b59b9245a44494236e72e9","2214ee1f7e7d4070de6564176a12fc5fad66a88f","3bda8b8dd09117f7d5abc12cf4581ac50b6412ee","409248947ac9a7a5d44f0741b332b05d2cea7b91","9d6a99b7bb39381807ce522a6e8d0066cf3e419e","5efc8e08e27d8f7b06a47d43291e861d2fb081f3","feb3ef3f626d612a9eba74dfe8395e57722a9d05","251c39c1b9372f3055cd53d0001fc122bfb2e418","b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5","327be2b81a1ed12ffd91ec3edac594a1bd077c9a","9b68dbd03143fedb6017186a25f99a6fd354dfa1","6408836505c85a6f4c0bfa7a2150b94939f42f0b","e815ddad024e743a70100436c3e6ea5a837585ed","acb9c890f732e77765760025a476fa86338c970d","9971ff92d9d09b4736228bdbd7726e2e19b9aa2d","66b498a54843e14270b75f0c3c8fc65a0b2e1e98","fb4eaa800d6dcdac909a3c16e95df58537db8c48","2db185c2a957384e14832632486b031d4b16c0ef","4859f412836b6293919163669fe1b363c304bf31","ab8f7571b9b2c29cec909ae467e54a5a255f22c1","accc424a638c2734d5f968ca6e17be9486c23ed0","3138142693a26d7ae117e6b6136c6c22b14a7bdb","7c96b189423a26019c6a69fb53c370abcd71890e","1fdb62555eb650662dbe2a6f3985d390861597c2","927ee7953e758d1f53e70f0fe6d81d1d086e43e7","f9c45a1beb146cd681ca822f587df88b03f64d01"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b95392418a699f5a83609d47a03031cefb49c305","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07423","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07423v1.pdf"],"venue":"ArXiv","journalName":"ArXiv","journalVolume":"abs/2103.07423","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Engineering"],"magId":"","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"e1e3f3ad706fe3f81b39d0897988baed44b43ae4","title":"Performance Comparison of Adaptive Neural Networks and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System in Brain Cancer Classification","paperAbstract":"Brain tumors are amongst the top death-leading health conditions worldwide. Biopsy is the most accurate procedure that determines the brain tumor type whether it is malignant or benign. However, biopsy may not be applicable for some patients with brain cancer (BCa) and could be life-threatening. In this paper, an intelligent diagnosticimage-based systems are implemented to assist physicians in making diagnostic decisions about the BCa type without biopsy procedures. A combined method of artificial intelligent systems and MRI image segmentation is proposed as a tumor classification tool. This study employs image filtration and segmentation on a region of interest (ROI) of an MRI image. Then, extract accurate statistical features are fed into four artificial intelligent (AI) systems: Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system(ANFIS), Elamn Neural Network (Elman NN), Nonlinear AutoRegressive with exogenous neural networks (NARXNN), and feedforward NN. The four AI classifiers are investigated and tested on 107 patients with brain tumors. The data base of the brain tumor images used in this study contains both malignant and benign cancers. The performance of the four intelligent tumor classifiers is evaluated. It is found that the NARX NN shows best performance with a classification accuracy of 99.1%. The achieved accuracy level is superior and could be very helpful in clinical purposes.","authors":[{"name":"Bassam  Al-Naami","ids":["9494449"]},{"name":"Mohammed Abu Mallouh","ids":["3057050"]},{"name":"Eman Abdel Hafez","ids":["94106604"]}],"inCitations":["6fcb587cbdbd0142e7343a2467a239b8efece6fb","de0870616122edc43331c5f2275a8a5c8221a6ed","4ebfee5796e82275a5391e4070008da32fdc2f03"],"outCitations":["04316de01c0023ff6aae21848b3006cf5e0ddb7b","5a12cf40fc9d0270c0356a9c3f89afb9ef2ac9e2","764180399461f6e49714cbb3f3270f346667f719","2d6ecfe0abb41a32f9784bbf7ac3df9177bea93f","a7f5a8fb71f6c939a876dcd2446ea4daeb00408e","668087f0ae7ce1de6e0bd0965dbb480c08103260","185dcb64825ed7179b1c03f2b89acb3be6043ed2","71b2e82d50d2233d9cccda6d2de8968a9cd94498","4273121c286a21c297054b8b53f591b1027e94b7","b33c7bc0527ad81ded99f2112f14de05b2eb8271","efdecb737db6a7ee25ea1b364b2b67d8fe8b2f91","fb590f973785c080ad403826a088fcd777dbaec7","0917e69f1cc50d2e0a1f9a9080eacc1dec223437","0945a13db0847dbfb770bf88a26c4d65c6486c66","9ef1a1a1379a082c87844da0edd17244e5d7c523","cbdc4731aab3efb1092b68320361f5178fc10f90","5c6ef8c44dc84d6e47600adf4459a777e9a2b46a","d6f94d678d89e825d2c420496466281d3dd1bfc7","e809cd3e1b65fb84f50bdf0ae2addcebdc0602f4","0c4eece8cd94bc4c66712cf22f5a0e184226bfae","75aa1f1a04b5f2bb6bf9afb662711121edde9eda","27131a5745f0200f50d23b9cd474404e887b07db","29c0abe01bef63c5a1d0fcfe8b4cc5c327e0cb86","0095b6bb7c92f5deeffa8a311b80f75e680325eb","436961dbe4d311bdfa0ee8cd17b4a937aa8e8477","3d94d3314062015c8225939caa7817e077183648","2ba233316af87ecc5e63a2277034a4dfb1f6c24f","25fdb44acbb2ea283e075a0147ff213954baf7dd","5e87ac0226bba92bdf1b10ddf4d4c2b75ee1429c","c0ec492db2abed05761ecc176ac9b7ebc7fa2c71"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1e3f3ad706fe3f81b39d0897988baed44b43ae4","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://jjmie.hu.edu.jo/vol%208-5/JJMIE-100-14-01.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2187795132","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"081bc2bd32f400e7f8e43f95ae414b56482a34b3","title":"Synthetic Q-Space Learning With Deep Regression Networks For Prostate Cancer Characterisation With Verdict","paperAbstract":"Traditional quantitative MRI (qMRI) signal model fitting to diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is slow and requires long computational time per patient. Recently, q-space learning utilises machine learning methods to overcome these issues and to infer diffusion metrics. However, most of q-space learning studies use simple multi layer perceptron (MLP) for model fitting, which might be sub-optimal when estimating more complex diffusion models with many free parameters. Previous works only investigate the application of q-space learning on diffusion models in the brain. In this work, we explore q-space learning for prostate cancer characterization. Our results show that while simple MLP is adequate to estimate parametric maps on simple models like classic VERDICT, deep residual regression networks are needed for more complex models such as VERDICT with compensated relaxation (R-VERDICT).","authors":[{"name":"Vanya  Valindria","ids":["2418404"]},{"name":"Marco  Palombo","ids":["115511180"]},{"name":"Eleni  Chiou","ids":["10308632"]},{"name":"Saurabh  Singh","ids":["2108498974"]},{"name":"Shonit  Punwani","ids":["144035606"]},{"name":"Eleftheria  Panagiotaki","ids":["2038897"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["185dff15b4593e1822facd31f1dcb8dd71406b6c","0fe8d95300fcd774b77eea82134d7b268a706c3b","1740fb74b8f7913338d91280f7c7c6f7940f073d","bd1967c25311040f309465453e39ec8030ae011e","ee2007c1f2aabe72bfa7eb7a93cd7df7c653ba7f","b89b8ff76a1c9b2f71d968fe817cae29209329eb","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","7cb255499685a2ea579316a9c155404b7d1da36b","a34e2d319d0435785cb6ca7c8c1dfe3d1dea28c7","803219b5b79a05391f063f1e0323012a8a5a9ad0","614d724b2e96eda04e8e3638c3b7599af90f0646","f21af6ea9c084f42a330cded201c219155418ae8","bcafc630721304e206db64e76adab2ecbb426796","662624bd4f64d7177c83f9f20f1284d27415892d","a984aea523eb874c8777b88a386ccaef54f871d0","0e263cd08be0d26d27ad72cb035e40d247efb0e6"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/081bc2bd32f400e7f8e43f95ae414b56482a34b3","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434096"],"venue":"2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","journalName":"2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"50-54","doi":"10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434096","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434096","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"6bade6885a9f73ddc0f539b743f31600b0084a2b","title":"Tumor Segmentation in Brain MRI using Fully Convolutional Network","paperAbstract":"In biomedical image processing and cancer studies tumor segmentation is one of the most indispensable tasks. Early diagnosis of tumorous cells aids substantially in early treatment planning and enhances the chance of survival of the patient. Manual segmentation of tumor cells in Brain MRI is difficult and time-consuming and also requires expertise in this field. In this paper, we have presented a deep Fully Convolutional Network designed using the TensorFlow library, which can successfully perform segmentation tasks in medical images. Brain MRI images of 225 patients are used as a training data set and a separate set from 20 patients is used to test the performance of the network. Two different loss functions: dice loss and weighted cross-entropy are used in the learning algorithm. We obtained a 0.76 Dice Score coefficient (i.e., 76% of the overlapping between the predicted image and ground truth) for a training of 100 epochs.","authors":[{"name":"Somnath","ids":["88891273"]},{"name":"Sachin  Negi","ids":["9405475"]},{"name":"Pranshu CBS Negi","ids":["2019706142"]},{"name":"Neeraj  Sharma","ids":["2087071009"]}],"inCitations":["ba6961160c10bab1b37b89dbee65d91133ba4acf"],"outCitations":["580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","2cebf0212380f83b7171fb5660f842c8d7043f60","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","317aee7fc081f2b137a85c4f20129007fd8e717e","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","46200b99c40e8586c8a0f588488ab6414119fb28","50004c086ffd6a201a4b782281aaa930fbfe6ecf","306b3d24b2147b55e048ad733f5b8556b0b7204e","8e2091f4c9ee8aa58a6d653ab32ff3a80f1625a0","68a0592bbca7e6ac97105b00a11fca50172675d8","f6d28c8674f546895ce79cabf16f7f8dabac99db"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6bade6885a9f73ddc0f539b743f31600b0084a2b","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2020 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication & Materials (ICACCM)","journalName":"2020 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication & Materials (ICACCM)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"158-161","doi":"10.1109/ICACCM50413.2020.9213036","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCM50413.2020.9213036","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3105697449","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"6812c5779de02074a69701f09c7605b59f5cd7da","title":"Magnetically-enabled and MR-monitored selective brain tumor protein delivery in rats via magnetic nanocarriers.","paperAbstract":"The delivery of bioactive proteins to tumors is associated with many difficulties that have impeded clinical translation of these promising therapeutics. Herein we present an approach, including (1) use of magnetically-responsive and MRI-visible nanoparticles as drug carriers, (2) topography-optimized intra-arterial magnetic targeting, (3) MRI-guided subject alignment within the magnetic field, and (4) surface modification of the protein drug with membrane-permeable polyethyleneimine (PEI), to prevail over the obstacles in protein delivery. Applying these methodologies, we demonstrated the delivery of a significant quantity of β-galactosidase selectively into brain tumors of glioma-bearing rats, while limiting the exposure of normal brain regions. Clinical viability of the technologies utilized, and the ability to deliver proteins at high nanomolar-range tumor concentrations, sufficient to completely eradicate a tumor lesion with existing picomolar-potency protein toxins, renders the prospect of enabling protein-based cancer therapy extremely promising.","authors":[{"name":"Beata  Chertok","ids":["3558355"]},{"name":"Allan E David","ids":["145358298"]},{"name":"Victor C Yang","ids":["2357634"]}],"inCitations":["ab823a550f379542ecf080b88e12f9d5d31b974d","653bc290e054e5734c7eac146a1ffc8065c75046","b18001ebeea8cb2b7295c7e5e66df6fb8a922c60","076a921791da37e0ae87f9a1a16c7128fca2c183","40616fda81c0c9df685c87f7f6e9bc90ad5d5d69","c1307a6db8592377503ad37a80a4950a00cc87ef","51565371e3a93306af54e5e78a7d30a90aba67e4","a02e64e8d3f347400560fa588191eed65e7cdb64","c079ff44debb74c3e92b8944f0e5ab998d696ecc","21cf8ba5f7965aff50269fc0115ad86e90aeccf3","ec37f8d9cbc1b3e4a38c4467c2361aa95b5eb4d9","e161495146990eefce875a72f5fff2705652f924","3c0d2eb10b72af96a3c82f011e2e75cc35cee65e","c99296322d6fe35690d404d74d645613f9a98430","09737f4389cd5851ddafbc8680401fda9b205b03","922b98573d3a638cdd5370c1a14eed81d148faf1","e435e2e0cd9ede983049baa59a5b88125f440d85","7918dfccdf2b84685c1bdde119bfb80eaea24bee","b01d7468fa8f4de2b32647e6b96ccad1c2e4c672","0f3778950f375a68e6f66fad2b0bff2f7083cf5a","ed15365a4f0cb59dbd1f9eec5921c9343b29287b","3c040c1533cb3a189ba0e9853f8770d3a5274926","6d276846f5b1a4373b04194bf399549d86f52cf6","45a3ff052cb36a74375b35fa1be36644d93dd7d5","fa69fac395ac6e1e3e146638bda3301d665b7f17","1bb07ce9bc0e7c649207457deb5f5e2876b2bf90","f8bc96564ecb350c988a4b02c9b545f465b75835","8dd2a404cc2675926a146205659d407463e9d100","0f3dc058b376867b2b0e02576172e6d3934e37d2","5f1aa1e9b9f06c831147c02eef6ad4e7af38d129","a5b36e44c23474ea3ebfbe5206caee2894b7fae7","eebe48a52e140cf58c38e848d4baa28bf5d7fa01","83e2b9b15ef30d497d09a993f194c18b3d3a7404","7ab5d6dc5fc5b168ce7b33596253c6f97a24df70","c6d714d635c035d35503b72aef19c56a5f239f52","3eba1d9cb83f83202102ff73387ab0040803a82b","0094ad94043e066968acbbc943ed7757557f75eb","631c6121ce4dd252983657f83fcc26013017c068","23407bf954b244578ac4c362e646154bedc01a4e","e85b9100b90f4429318170a1b04cc5a645b2f344","d9ed65e3e93c77a091e8665a15f6b1362ff6e4be","7711b64946f4e1a7489045263485a70faee1642a","d6561fdac9b62f4d9acd217ffea103ff6143d3d9","840c2c2bcc74c49e4c481566a879ca128b0964f0","471af1e6d32f3009f174f707c7ab357e0d376e18"],"outCitations":["3cf9a33de940fa4c33544dfbc7854e6cdd02427d","a7bc63e4df4c0f7d1830672f41690d5f3f0b348c","cbf968452d02118984f5ec6ab863ab463e6217a4","a281c94618e0cabbd89ac19b5d25b54bffd2cdfb","2854ade7eadc3fa9970c6a547a02e009e0656f5e","67602bc3a32a8d30ddc9666cb791a8d70daa4c19","4e822688943c88be33eaebd028bcf98edffb7e26","8de490482dc51299e0c37b12b6297fb7c64230b4","2f77df319827925f8267ab54eab89cf726d58d1b","108a3842f491925770368126754f286418fe8484","bac43cafbd6d16ee57a52833dd7259feb48b5610","3ae5d350f34ffecd357a9c71bb1f53a670215c01","4c1a93f3e02b13e2d7bcbbaaa9110ab4e91176c0","523b6246febf860709411adb121e9771afec72f8","f0aa7eb8b0db3997a7635f5e51891ff38a4b1dde","ec792ad26936da602c85f412977eec0090ea5901","044b737ffeaedf2abb471c68fa09df8788c2830a","81aeb78ead2f0d029db1543c3a8c132b28d25142","2f6c4ad236f65a9dcf78382aa5d74440580dea73","635acb88aff48971d54de0a6cfa23dffcacf0b6f","56fa427af145fd4e0e96eb42f520c5aaecfd586c","b39716405975a7a465e20b7c79fe780efad070a3","fa160778d063122496e18dc90a7edb18a56c7775","2272951607a7ed0c7ed0a77ad997c40e30e3a699","89d9ae6b02a1138d18304769ef6af9ba495d2c00","830a5c5daea272a33fb10984488e58e359010cad","c484556ccf0c2d6f629063803aa39295a8f5fc49","ae8986eeea659501b8660b78b7b3ad70556dfbc7","9eb73c0849afeb8384dc82a41b29ad7bdde18a96","9e40e5e98a60542ba69647197b4a8fc5dcc1393d","cd2dbe89a52c5a69e115597333954e542e598b43","fc242d0c51fdc9b173e838635aff2a6f00501a01","9b8e02dbb9b0a4b2d8683054e7023b570498a1b6","969b22adac26445821ed7149b0b04e76a3324c8f","5d6dc7a271a7d72a53bd324163c89764c9259277"],"year":2011,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6812c5779de02074a69701f09c7605b59f5cd7da","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Biomaterials","journalName":"Biomaterials","journalVolume":"32 26","journalPages":"\n          6245-53\n        ","doi":"10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.004","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.004","pmid":"21632104","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2076979446","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"b2c0a3ef7238828ed6267e86409a2ec6d4a0c2e5","title":"Tumor Detection and Segmentation UsingWatershed and Hierarchical ClusteringAlgorithms","paperAbstract":"Tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue which may be solid or fluid.

It has been shown that the most effective methods of reducing mortality are early detection and treatment of brain cancer. The automatic MR image classification of meningioma has been widely used in cancer diagnosis and treatment. In order to analyze medical images, Convolutionary Neural Networks (CNNs) have quickly become the method of choice. In many practical applications, such as medical image classification, CNNs, to date, have achieved breakthrough performance. In this work, due to the benefits of DL, a deep Convolutionary Neural Network (DCNN) based architecture is presented to diagnose and classify brain tumours and assign grade to them. CAD systems can provide the diagnosis depending on the specific characteristics present in the medical images. A comprehensive method for diagnosing the cancerous region in the MRI images is proposed in the present study. The overall classification of brain tumour accuracy of the proposed DCNN method is 97.73, ResNet50 is 95.62, DenseNet121 is 96.22 and 95.91.

It refers to an unstable growth of cells that potentially invade the surrounding tissues and may eventually lead to edema or even death. On the other hand, the term tumor is often misleading since people assume that it is the same as cancer, but this is not necessarily true. A cancer is a particularly threatening type of tumor. The word tumor simply refers to a mass, and in particular a brain tumor is a mass located in the patient’s brain that may seriously threaten his/her life. Thus, it is crucial to study which factors may influence the outcome of a brain tumor to improve the given treatment or even make the patient more contented. Therefore, this study presents a decision support system based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data or knowledge (if the data is presented in context) that allows for brain tumor outcome prediction. It describes an innovative approach to cater for brain illness where Logic Programming comes in support of a computational approach based on Case Based Reasoning. An attempt is made to predict whether a patient will die or survive with or without a tumor, where the data or knowledge may be of type unknown, incomplete or even self-contradictory.","authors":[{"name":"Cristiana  Neto","ids":["2052780036"]},{"name":"Inês  Dias","ids":["1388660170"]},{"name":"Maria do Rosário Girão Santos","ids":["145636214"]},{"name":"Victor  Alves","ids":["2061636918"]},{"name":"Filipa  Ferraz","ids":["2971209"]},{"name":"João  Neves","ids":["144251120"]},{"name":"Henrique  Vicente","ids":["143843590"]},{"name":"José  Neves","ids":["144750070"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["ce70030c9d4e2ce2280cc15f50da42ea755d37d3","b009bc3c853ecfa6acb8b23533d0cc93f6c0da21","34ced4a55cad83c7321c7643e9c0df79de0af144","4fe81aa581845396c06e47c53d975c3895152aee","a431458588753c24d74363cd49910e5480bf247e","11ed3e2a39f7e22242da5eb6429b7b6d1bb766bb","c67554ba3ae797a0a644d9e808ee400278d576de","ed13e2b5698ccbb6a72e8167c95b4317358db5df","bd010c90d702c0925708d27c1fd2aed5752f7957","73a8837400b13f64796e41e12adc6621b10a4f39","c829ea9e1f7bb22c28f21a7aca2b435223abb677","995b94cb4246172843153414c1e6dc4cb004dbf4","ccc7561778ecd5b40c00acb8f5b5f8deb3ff8ef4","11f48f7ddd9cf79bc4351e8642efff2224757c9e","3431bad161681cdb5095f26c90aa6e09546b50f1"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/489d053207b791487da68d47691c79e6607db777","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-10","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-01662-3_1","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01662-3_1","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2909679475","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"00fbcd350b45701b031580d7cc742d76ac9b58a3","title":"Comparative Study on Histogram Equalization Techniques for Medical Image Enhancement","paperAbstract":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used for analyzing and diagnosing diseases such as cancer or tumor in a brain.

MRI images are low-contrast images which lead to difficulty in diagnoses, hence better localization of image pixels is required. Histogram equalization techniques help to enhance the image so that it gives an improved visual quality and a well-defined problem. The contrast and brightness are enhanced in such a way that it does not lose its original information and the brightness is preserved. In this paper, we compared the different equalization techniques which are critically studied and elaborated.

Recent advances in CBT, has heightened interest in the non-invasive monitoring of transplanted cells in in vivo MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data. These cells appear as dark spots in MRI scans. However, to date, these spots are manually labeled by experts, which is an extremely tedious and a time consuming process. This limits the ability to conduct large scale spot analysis that is necessary for the long term success of CBT. To address this gap, we develop methods to automate the spot detection task. In this regard we (a) assemble an annotated MRI database for spot detection in MRI; (b) present a superpixel based strategy to extract regions of interest from MRI; (c) design a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for automatically characterizing and classifying spots in MRI; (d) propose a transfer learning approach to circumvent the issue of limited training data, and (e) propose a new CNN framework that exploits labeling behavior of the expert in the learning process. Extensive experiments convey the benefits of the proposed methods.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Jamal Afridi","ids":["2299300"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8fdf346bfc01376dc9ed98c61717878a6fe91aa0","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.egr.msu.edu/sites/default/files/pdf-defense/muhammad_jamal_afridi_1_3_17.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2608523703","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"47cd4ffd3843d6416754ca5c344ed550be039993","title":"An automated MRI brain image segmentation and tumor detection using SOM-clustering and Proximal Support Vector Machine classifier","paperAbstract":"In recent days, image processing is an interesting research field and mainly the medical image processing is increasingly challenging field to process various medical image types. It is widely used in diagnosis of disease such as brain tumor, Cancer, Diabetes etc. and brain tumor is one such dangerous disease and currently moreover 600,000 people have this type of disease. Image segmentation is an important technique highly used to extract the suspicious parts from medical images such as MRI, CT scan, and Mammography etc. With this motivation in this work, SOM clustering is proposed for MRI brain image segmentation. Before the segmentation the Histogram Equalization is utilized for feature extraction which will improve the segmentation accuracy. After the segmentation process, the feature extraction using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix is utilized which avoids the formation of misclustered regions. The Principle Component Analysis (PCA) method is used for the feature selection to improve the classifier accuracy. An effective classifier Proximal Support Vector Machines (PSVM) is used to automatically detect the tumor from MRI brain image. This method is faster and computationally more efficient than the existing method SVM. While the SOM clustering with Histogram Equalization is a fast procedure for the segmentation of the whole volume and provides a way to model tissue classes, the PSVM-GLCM-PCA approach is a more robust scheme under noisy or bad intensity normalization conditions which produces better results using high resolution images, outperforming the results provided by other algorithms in the state-of-the art, in terms of the average overlap metric.","authors":[{"name":"K.

Therefore, it is an area where building new tools to more effectively diagnose the disease and cure the disease can have a major impact on a large proportion of the population. Today we have a lot of data at our disposal about the patient about the tissue sample and our goal is to use this data effectively to provide the most accurate diagnosis for the patient. The conventional method involves the classification of brain tumors by inspecting the MRI images of the patients. However, a large amount of data available for different specific types of brain tumors makes this method very time consuming and prone to human errors. In the paper, we tried to design a model using a convolution neural network to identify the tumor and non-tumor MRI images. The architecture proposed in the paper consisted of one of each convolution layer, max-pooling layer, fully connected layer, and hidden layer. The model was trained on Brain tumor dataset (BRATS 2017) consisting of 320 images in the training set and 80 images in the test set. We were able to achieve the training accuracy of 89.25and validation accuracy of 97.5 using this simple architecture.","authors":[{"name":"Anushka  Singh","ids":["2111008949"]},{"name":"Rajeshwari  Deshmukh","ids":["2065872217"]},{"name":"Riya  Jha","ids":["1657340493"]},{"name":"Nishi  Shahare","ids":["84270147"]},{"name":"Sonam  Verma","ids":["2114073490"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["18be0fc5c3fc58c26660dbb5e26d1d600072f939","28eb47f734827e62a480c9259113d461e5630713","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","9a7578950115ba7326e1a491e0f2f93445c59cbc","5889f18e717a9c66f3cdf664d6d5b79d7de04fd5","dc169f30f62d57f3785090e33ef1875df5124ec5","215582267358c612e511c46d112ef8273d563cae","fc37722bb49bfb716f4baf546891d78077e8bfca","84c4e81079cf131e9a7d187dec3acabe0be7573c","99eb1f3835dd59f933d01aa27206e18c9e8c23c4"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f069b7d20b9b6e21ab707adfafbaf1270834fe58","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijariie.com/AdminUploadPdf/Brain_Tumor_Classification_using_Convolutional_neural_Network_ijariie11732.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Advance Research and Innovative Ideas in Education","journalVolume":"6","journalPages":"1353-1357","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3014460868","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a778a9040640e64ad08a66ec1e2837dd7903ee39","title":"Integrating deep transfer learning and radiomics features in glioblastoma multiforme patient survival prediction","paperAbstract":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the largest and most genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous category of primary brain tumors. Numerous novel chemical, targeted molecular and immune-active therapies in trial produce promising responses in a small disparate subset of patients but which patient will respond to which therapy remains unpredictable. Reliable imaging biomarkers for prediction and early detection of treatment response and survival are critical needs in neuro-oncology. In this study, brain tumor MRI 'deep features' extracted via transfer learning techniques were combined with features derived from an explicitly designed radiomics model to search for MRI markers predictive of overall survival (OS) in GBM patients. Two pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models were utilized as the deep learning models and the elastic net-Cox model was performed to distinguish GBM patients into two survival groups. Two patient cohorts were included in this study. One was 50 GBM patients from our hospital and the other was 128 GBM patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Image Archive (TCIA). The combined feature framework was predictive of OS in both data set with log-rank test p-value < 0.05 and may merit further study for reproducible prediction of treatment response.","authors":[{"name":"Wei  Han","ids":["72549949"]},{"name":"Lei  Qin","ids":["123629657"]},{"name":"Camden  Bay","ids":["32467266"]},{"name":"Xin  Chen","ids":["46772171"]},{"name":"Kun-Hsing  Yu","ids":["47841171"]},{"name":"Angie  Li","ids":["35134597"]},{"name":"Xiaoyin  Xu","ids":["30992289"]},{"name":"Geoffrey S.

The diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) requires a variety of medical tests, which leads to huge amounts of multivariate heterogeneous data. It can be difficult and exhausting to manually compare, visualize, and analyze this data due to the heterogeneous nature of medical tests; therefore, an efficient approach for accurate prediction of the condition of the brain through the classification of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images is greatly beneficial and yet very challenging. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for the diagnosis of very early stages of AD through an efficient classification of brain MRI images, which uses label propagation in a manifold-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first apply voxel morphometry analysis to extract some of the most critical AD-related features of brain images from the original MRI volumes and also gray matter (GM) segmentation volumes. The features must capture the most discriminative properties that vary between a healthy and Alzheimer-affected brain. Next, we perform a principal component analysis (PCA)-based dimension reduction on the extracted features for faster yet sufficiently accurate analysis. To make the best use of the captured features, we present a hybrid manifold learning framework which embeds the feature vectors in a subspace. Next, using a small set of labeled training data, we apply a label propagation method in the created manifold space to predict the labels of the remaining images and classify them in the two groups of mild Alzheimer’s and normal condition (MCI/NC). The accuracy of the classification using the proposed method is 93.86% for the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database of MRI brain images, providing, compared to the best existing methods, a 3% lower error rate.","authors":[{"name":"Moein  Khajehnejad","ids":["34606412"]},{"name":"Forough  Habibollahi Saatlou","ids":["116802977"]},{"name":"Hoda  Mohammadzade","ids":["1782221"]}],"inCitations":["e790932b0ecb8ea31ee3704b3d136d61c7f59e9c","ec81d65fda9d632b239de8dd797739e200723a0e","4d2745bdca51c2e9ffc75f4c8e38e5c86b072194","93ae71aa6b1736b2b777c3566b6144196c7ccadd","e889e2cbe4d6882b08ee0f133b74b23cd67cc761","f3fabca0969ac389184f38bd66e69ab876006dfd","5a066f75668f466d706068f0fcefaac89ec28706","a8efca841e6a347688a87dcbc5194557cde0bfb1","4bb33fc9c1e32a8a0146c7d2f87b048903f41f1c","59c121772688fc23725088d87468322486b362e8","99c9384df2bc4094f1a927b33e017bf579fd0f1b","17ef6016c7d416875ea048173b3abdf4284000f4","99304d05138c258ec029834d8e52df9353d73926","0b09e296c504f823bf3a4d2dbd96ea81ad5a9b38","6b0e290341e3cdd4252cca88a35c1d3e40be84a0","b12e9e5d3edeb2bd8040fba0c7a9b74755dd81ef"],"outCitations":["104a7c1bde64cb92e0922d5306697f08ddbbd37b","517e397405f6ecb5d51e9b1237771a5e04b04da2","d6e1a462a5f087271bfad57ff14c937cbcdab43b","66783753253af1ed5bc2b3410035b7c6b27f925d","f935380afa97ab2bdb35c3dacc3c46d02018d833","ba316d02bb3478e337f14f7c76b32054a6185562","3caa4e3c3477d9d16a603e8b1dad81de38810c62","7e40c88fb511bfcdb433b4a3ac866b0872d92f0b","cb1fabd765f28f4e61a5e6771b1468cb9a113fc4","0b74dd2397001588673891771de6c221fb91a894","80827023c68423dc8809f3f8d85fce72d7103e97","220763e91b67ad69f7c833bfedf33bb29b278d85","c9fa385527ba3c7b6b497229d1a000a554cdc08c","0250b5c0f7a414dec8c7a0aa7be20c9637eeb6ec","bb94c5a38c5e0eb4f6568bf9895d4ff00dae03c9","94559c249d204110296c39ed4af2042cc4468e68","20bfc39030a8b17ef69961b4266cd15882105e85","101aad03db53cac05e89e5d474fe68948afae09d","1b9184dff4390d65df39f21dc103a85fd0c66e64","a6801e67dd77fefa16359ac62da90cb2ed2a97ac","26bddc813bd5ee2afdd46b24ed63e01e21347e38","236cb915a1724c4b9ec3e53cfed64ce169358cda","2a97dc1c322b198b8a3689c20b0fe3cfff5c28ce","3537fcd0ff99a3b3cb3d279012df826358420556","2a4ca461fa847e8433bab67e7bfe4620371c1f77","0cb19a26bb880b51efb86392a92bb782df843ce7","234a5282a9e078f7f2c58a5d246c3369b34fbe69","efd4603b3e5186d466edf4d7c6e0d5bee1c1acea","3d13d6f847e8f4c76c5a8d6f99fa49dbabe473c0","073f83f6b0dafc835a2166f1f7518a8fb2b0fa09","440d781c1a999c5f03e98a8ec5f5d0571e84fbe0","e197caab023d0d40aec7d96e622dc2cbc14e6971","144457047be2820246fb41b9f552d14cc988d4c6","cdfa8b3ff5cbdcfe683faf6be23f62d2c46b2a8f","e5990ab10adfaea19f505109a8bb4b4372d4f291","d67ace21b124af25d9d0426be9f7bf0d1ff9736a","a45e8c83e137b5b4490be0046784e9f74ce1216a","57c0b459790a4e80964f6b2c5dca3adb2e5b21f9","755b762df7b59e86de6dc9c75a3ada6d1977faae","57da7e969b459d689277c0c3643d9bf957f454fd","3fa3a1d519e7a40176b1d2e4e34655181e2a8391","32827e630492895e77783213a21b0959b22543f1","436e9f2a5a1739fd2a58cf5f7c005fd0445178e4","948f53e8b41333826293b9d3b8ecbf87611ff092","bb95ef99ae56f6b1087d6a3aec6ba18b766b237a","46770a8e7e2af28f5253e5961f709be74e34c1f6","0a13ad6eebe5e922cef16560fc39684dadcd097f","6999b22c6afdd75490a5f3e576607cc4842d05e6","03c3666622ebce19230744b25cebf317f79a88ef","07170b3bc117c84246adda15a4a1626785f826ca","d8909d360ba67d6e4d140d69d4e63c38c60e8a5c","bfa8c99e406112f1d5737e613a073c36d93d7dd2"],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7bee702bd453cdc027fb94ba52cc54d380fc3c1e","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":["http://sharif.edu/~hoda/papers/Alzheimer.pdf","http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/7/8/109/pdf"],"venue":"Brain sciences","journalName":"Brain Sciences","journalVolume":"7","journalPages":"","doi":"10.3390/brainsci7080109","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci7080109","pmid":"28825647","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2747708921","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"558471a07492edb85c96e6b6a5cb2ea627bce514","title":"Brain Cancer Diagnosis and Prediction Based on Neural Gas Network and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy","paperAbstract":"Abstract The Neural Gas Networks (NGN) is considered one of the most and popular algorithms in most researches.

Therefore, early stage tumor detection is useful for increase of survival rate although it is challenging because of numerous prolific image factors including poor contrast, complex background, brightness issues, shape of infected region and fuzzy borders. Practically in recent times, numerous computerized aided systems (CAD) perform better for the detection of various sorts of tumors in brain, breast, skin and lung. These body organs are analyzed through different modalities for exampple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), dermoscopic, mammography and positron emission tomography (PET) etc. The major objective is to extensively analyze existing methodologies for brain, breast, skin and lung cancer/tumor detection. The survey is organized in terms of computer vision employed for cancer/tumor detection.

Medical image segmentation requires sophisticated computerized quantifications and visualization tools. Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, tumors or organs can be quickly and accurately detected and automatically contoured from medical images. This paper introduces a platform-independent, multi-modality image registration, segmentation, and 3D visualization program, named artificial intelligence-based medical image segmentation for 3D printing and naked eye 3D visualization (AIMIS3D). YOLOV3 algorithm was used to recognize prostate organ from T2-weighted MRI images with proper training. Prostate cancer and bladder cancer were segmented based on U-net from MRI images. CT images of osteosarcoma were loaded into the platform for the segmentation of lumbar spine, osteosarcoma, vessels, and local nerves for 3D printing. Breast displacement during each radiation therapy was quantitatively evaluated by automatically identifying the position of the 3D printed plastic breast bra. Brain vessel from multi-modality MRI images was segmented by using model-based transfer learning for 3D printing and naked eye 3D visualization in AIMIS3D platform.","authors":[{"name":"Guang  Jia","ids":[]},{"name":"Xunan  Huang","ids":["8782279"]},{"name":"Sen  Tao","ids":[]},{"name":"Xianghuai  Zhang","ids":[]},{"name":"Yue  Zhao","ids":[]},{"name":"Hongcai  Wang","ids":[]},{"name":"Jie  He","ids":[]},{"name":"Jiaxue  Hao","ids":[]},{"name":"Bo  Liu","ids":[]},{"name":"Jiejing  Zhou","ids":[]},{"name":"Tanping  Li","ids":[]},{"name":"Xiaoling  Zhang","ids":[]},{"name":"Jinglong  Gao","ids":["2025998733"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["86ce9a7bdbd1819e3082e0047734658f93ef3fc8","16aa01ca0834a924c25faad5d8bfef3fd1acfcfe","3a07885d39ad19602f42d2e3a7905040d68e5918","0f1c31aa40a7d0b3ba68a6d1ef2bfc92e7f8ae0d","09ee79cf0d8b921a90807befa8a90f2497f124c9","efcfb79f4cd92db09dbb21e9e8cd25dbcccd5460","e0def24d0665daf983eb3c37461067be3c91cea1","10da7dac6a89ee4501727aa8f71d4c4604bce0ce","77f0a39b8e02686fd85b01971f8feb7f60971f80","edd80bb16ea558e5565c87e5709f3cf519828bf7","091b45bdef1447d6772b9d14e1f6c9c566460a29","0cf069583a096b4b60459b5379189f6938b11282","29bfbdf16d4b59c67085ab928cad384a44476cd5","0d12684769218bd433239468093bb5dd030c954e","8e9f1547dcf25ecc918049243c1e378e6fcb0016","caf5f5ab07907a89ccdc1be8989d301c35bb8f93","e1ec11a1cb3d9745fb18d3bf74247f95a6663d08","555105e7dbad980f5503c3455578a8b5891f804c","071250ea033f65c5782482d19717f53da7221546","a8bb35160782f92c90978bcd1e1711823661e0a4","82f8bde482f4132a4f52321ec2a001f559a39f64","5a7db1e9ef36c2f9b67d33bc08b8de2816fa4d1e","9f2765851709ce0ec2104ca74ca88d2f3c51935a","04336698f50ca257bc1c965a1928813f9aa66a14","770513f9d0c9c6e7085dbbb8187205ff88ab9e11","98454bde6b989251034266c6ae699f7b7c96d6e8","aa4b53329efa2fa1bc2aae5ab34baa945945125b","f7cb58050c265a98eda4d49efad492892cb7e628","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","664c591c860ae5d6016c0b29960d75cbf2e3f360","761031fe6084daa542565d54eac19b6d3a613f1b","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","59249dcd2e67bab1ab68e771092138392479d7ea"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a3d820a6343ad7e2f347ddb8804025f4af59a46f","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1016/J.IMED.2021.04.001","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/J.IMED.2021.04.001","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3157306649","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"ce8fb48a571eb7823f550e2bfc033ad25286fba0","title":"Ex vivo tissue imaging of human glioblastoma using a small bore 7T MRI and correlation with digital pathology and proteomics profiling","paperAbstract":"Recent advancement in MRI established multi-parametric imaging for in vivo characterization of pathologic changes in brain cancer, which is expected to play a role in imaging biomarker development. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a prime example, which has been deployed for assessment of therapeutic response via analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) / mean diffusivity (MD) values. They have been speculated to reflect apoptosis/necrosis. As newer medical imaging emerges, it is essential to verify that apparent abnormal features in imaging correlate with histopathology. Furthermore, the feasibility of imaging correlation with molecular profile should be explored in order to enhance the potential of biomedical imaging as a reliable biomarker. We focus on glioblastoma, which is an aggressive brain cancer. Despite the increased number of studies involving DTI in glioblastoma; however, little has been explored to bridge the gap between the molecular biomarkers and DTI data. Due to spatial heterogeneity in, MRI signals, pathologic change and protein expression, precise correlation is required between DTI, pathology and proteomics data in a histoanatomically identical manner. The challenge is obtaining an identical plane from in vivo imaging data that exactly matches with histopathology section. Thus, we propose to incorporate ex vivo tissue imaging to bridge between in vivo imaging data and histopathology. With ex vivo scan of removed tissue, it is feasible to use high-field 7T MRI scanner, which can achieve microscopic resolution. Once histology section showing the identical plane, it is feasible to correlate protein expression by a unique technology, “multiplex tissue immunoblotting”.","authors":[{"name":"Kant M.

In a similar way, MRI could be the cutting edge regenerative imaging technology, which permits an angle sectional perspective of the body, which gives convenience to specialists and will be inspect the affected person. The image sent by MRI is detailed which enables it to recognize the improvements of structures throughout the body, and is usually a basic part in finding and treatment planning. In this paper, the author had attempted the strategy to classify MRI images (4-Dimensional) either at the beginning of production to have a tumor or even can be utilized for tumor recognition. During pre-processing, the author has to execute image enhancement regarding varying the advanced images for a future check-up. The aim of the study is to address the aforementioned problems associated with the brain cancer due to the leakage of CSF. In this research work, the author focuses on brain tumor and applies the statistical model for the testing and also discusses the images of brain tumor. This research discusses the pathologist's significance, as it is a bit difficult for a common person to readily observe the tumor region simply by observing MRI pictures as pathologists and engineers of MRI. They can judge the tumor region by conducting a comparative image analysis and applying HoG function afterwards to construct a classifier that could be prepared to predict tumor and non-tumor MRI examinees on the basis of the aid vector machine.

So, effective detection of brain tumors is more important in the medical field to analyze the tumor portion. Detecting tumors prior and diagnosis of tumors can play a major role in preventing human death due to brain tumors. To detect the tumor portion, many segmentation and classification methods have been proposed. For the effect segmentation process, enhancing brain images is necessary. In this present paper, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images have been taken as test images. The proposed enhancement method has two major phases. The first phase contains a regularization process in two steps to equalize the test images' intensities, and the second phase contains a mapping process of two steps to enhance the contrast of the image and remap their intensity values to the natural dynamic range.","authors":[{"name":"A.

The radiologist plays a vital role in diagnosing a disease. Manual classification is a time consuming process and can cause human errors. Our objective is to develop a fully automated classification method for identification of brain cancers. Methods: This paper proposes a Bio Inspired Hybrid Krill Herd-Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) Network which classifies the Brain images into one of the classes namely normal image, Astrocytoma cancer, Meningioma cancer or Oligidendroglioma cancer. The most essential part of the research is to find the local and global features from the brain cancer images. In this proposed method, both Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features are used for feature extraction. The real time brain database is obtained from Jansons MRI Diagnostic centre Erode during November 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014 consisting of 400 images with their ages ranging from 20 to 65 years. In our experiment, 85 samples aretaken for training and the remaining 15 samples are taken for testing. Initially, the local feature information is extracted using LBP method and the overall global features are extracted using GLCM method. By these methods, the brain images are fully illustrated using local and global features. Then the statistical technique is used for feature sub selection where the variance of each features are calculated. The selected features from statistical technique is fed as inputs to the ELM Neural Network classifier where the weights are optimized using Krill Herd algorithm.Results: This proposed hybrid approach achieves 98.9% accuracy when compared with other traditional techniques.","authors":[{"name":"J.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most popular acquisition modalities which is widely used in brain tumour analysis and can be acquired with different acquisition protocols, e.g. conventional and advanced. Automated segmentation of brain tumours in MR images is a difficult task due to their high variation in size, shape and appearance. Although many studies have been conducted, it still remains a challenging task and improving accuracy of tumour segmentation is an ongoing field. The aim of this thesis is to develop a fully automated method for detection and segmentation of the abnormal tissue associated with brain tumour (tumour core and oedema) from multimodal MRI images. \nIn this thesis, firstly, the whole brain tumour is segmented from fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI, which is commonly acquired in clinics. The segmentation is achieved using region-wise classification, in which regions are derived from superpixels. Several image features including intensity-based, Gabor textons, fractal analysis and curvatures are calculated from each superpixel within the entire brain area in FLAIR MRI to ensure a robust classification. Extremely randomised trees (ERT) classifies each superpixel into tumour and non-tumour. Secondly, the method is extended to 3D supervoxel based learning for segmentation and classification of tumour tissue subtypes in multimodal MRI brain images. Supervoxels are generated using the information across the multimodal MRI data set. This is then followed by a random forests (RF) classifier to classify each supervoxel into tumour core, oedema or healthy brain tissue. The information from the advanced protocols of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), i.e. isotropic (p) and anisotropic (q) components is also incorporated to the conventional MRI to improve segmentation accuracy. Thirdly, to further improve the segmentation of tumour tissue subtypes, the machine-learned features from fully convolutional neural network (FCN) are investigated and combined with hand-designed texton features to encode global information and local dependencies into feature representation. The score map with pixel-wise predictions is used as a feature map which is learned from multimodal MRI training dataset using the FCN. The machine-learned features, along with hand-designed texton features are then applied to random forests to classify each MRI image voxel into normal brain tissues and different parts of tumour. \nThe methods are evaluated on two datasets: 1) clinical dataset, and 2) publicly available Multimodal Brain Tumour Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) 2013 and 2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the high detection and segmentation performance of the \nIII \nsingle modal (FLAIR) method. The average detection sensitivity, balanced error rate (BER) and the Dice overlap measure for the segmented tumour against the ground truth for the clinical data are 89.48%, 6% and 0.91, respectively; whilst, for the BRATS dataset, the corresponding evaluation results are 88.09%, 6% and 0.88, respectively. The corresponding results for the tumour (including tumour core and oedema) in the case of multimodal MRI method are 86%, 7%, 0.84, for the clinical dataset and 96%, 2% and 0.89 for the BRATS 2013 dataset. The results of the FCN based method show that the application of the RF classifier to multimodal MRI images using machine-learned features based on FCN and hand-designed features based on textons provides promising segmentations. The Dice overlap measure for automatic brain tumor segmentation against ground truth for the BRATS 2013 dataset is 0.88, 0.80 and 0.73 for complete tumor, core and enhancing tumor, respectively, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods. The corresponding results for BRATS 2017 dataset are 0.86, 0.78 and 0.66 respectively. \nThe methods demonstrate promising results in the segmentation of brain tumours. This provides a close match to expert delineation across all grades of glioma, leading to a faster and more reproducible method of brain tumour detection and delineation to aid patient management. In the experiments, texton has demonstrated its advantages of providing significant information to distinguish various patterns in both 2D and 3D spaces. The segmentation accuracy has also been largely increased by fusing information from multimodal MRI images. Moreover, a unified framework is present which complementarily integrates hand-designed features with machine-learned features to produce more accurate segmentation. The hand-designed features from shallow network (with designable filters) encode the prior-knowledge and context while the machine-learned features from a deep network (with trainable filters) learn the intrinsic features. Both global and local information are combined using these two types of networks that improve the segmentation accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza  Soltaninejad","ids":["3185139"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0f680616751a42fc1c0198e435dd2fe3bf53d9bc","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/30883/1/30883%20Soltaninejad","%20Mohammadreza%20-%20Computer%20Science%20-%20November%202017.pdf","http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/30883/"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2784389611","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"e4701b4a4979a46954402fb581d279ccf768173d","title":"De-noising of noisy MRI brain image using the switching-based clustering algorithm","paperAbstract":"Magnetic Resonance Image is one of the technologies used for diagnosing brain cancer. Radiographers use the information obtained from MRI images to diagnose the disease and plan further treatment for the patient. MRI images are always corrupted with noise. Removing noise from images is crucial but it is not an easy task. Filtering algorithm is the most common method used to remove noise. A segmentation technique is normally used to process the image in order to detect the abnormality that has been observed, specifically in the brain. However, segmentation alone would be best to implement when the images are in good condition. In the case where the images are corrupted with noise, there are pre-processing steps that need to be implemented first before we can proceed to the next task. Therefore, in this project, we have proposed a simpler method that can de-noise and at the same time segment the image into several significant regions. The proposed method is called the switching-based clustering algorithm. The algorithm is implemented on the MRI brain images which are corrupted with a certain level of salt-and-pepper noise. During the segmentation process, the results show that the proposed algorithm has the ability to minimize the effect of noise without degrading the original images. The density of noise in the MRI images varies from 5% to 20%. The results are compared with the conventional clustering algorithm. Based on the experimental result obtained, the switching-based algorithm provides a better segmentation performance with fewer noise effects than the conventional clustering algorithm. Quantitative and qualitative analyses have shown positive results for the proposed switching-based clustering algorithm.","authors":[{"name":"Siti Noraini Sulaiman","ids":["31756067"]},{"name":"Siti Mastura Che Ishak","ids":["1879575"]},{"name":"Iza Sazanita Isa","ids":["143743624"]},{"name":"Norhazimi  Hamzah","ids":["49301692"]}],"inCitations":["8f52afeb5d970e067a14d0b03ea4d3c2e465e6dc","1fc3a2b21d6d20961659ecc55eca8b046f6e0cb5","c7d43c78a60a3ce9eb74dbe3960f252bce9f018e","1a7016ffab4fb8a774fcd454eb0e85eef4e83d54","a34f6c469bcfd6a2623b6b95f4854187cef4f2cb","a151fea0bb089b7eaa2a454bc2cdd6347e3bccb9","5bf8bce940df20875bafd790d4defb98eedcfd2e"],"outCitations":["0d479a61559d8706a2e71d2e8f20efb54bd177fd","ee3e1cfa4604f9b6fdc3e7a06984d8396080a6e6","98513f4a5288cfc1f6ad432785bd1729f56fc9f1","7fa9d4a034b7c01647fbf5db3baea86c9efad629","f179749c55b78bf258bede455c646bea3229691b","7fc9be0683b6ace89323762888b3b4abfec11eaa","4d96a5577a57a4b342c10abd95eb6fee93786489","951f878bcbed2f9c1d0dab8432957dd841aaa413","f4145c995bd7fc3415d8a366a2bf25d100d7b9a9","72fece621750008cdf71d8dd19e475297a2ec467","330efb00b5edd9d51b8968521e4ed7a06da79899","d2dfd3d1237cc0430a9ee7e96f0fb3d262a807f1","a7a71e863469a0e1746771836a0f678325261ab3","c57a7f27f2875890e24cb550e46d6ef8e7ecc215","94af5a9432fd043807f749f38a519480de9f258b","712322e8c9c65016dfbddf5d086f202f58980337"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e4701b4a4979a46954402fb581d279ccf768173d","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://acscrg.com/iccsce/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ScheduleICCSCE2014_21Nov2014.pdf","http://acscrg.com/iccsce/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Schedule_2014_Website_update_13Nov2014.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072679"],"venue":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","journalName":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-6","doi":"10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072679","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072679","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"1996004307","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a31da408969212375d2356aa661826634946a297","title":"Optimization of illumination in interstitial photodynamic therapy for high-grade brain tumors","paperAbstract":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for brain tumors appears to be complementary to conventional treatments (Cancer Treat Rev, 2012). Xenografts of human glioblastoma cells were implanted stereotactically in nude rat brain for interstitial PDT (iPDT) of brain tumors guided by real-time imaging. Multifunctional nanoparticles consist of a surface-localized tumor vasculature targeting neuropilin-1 ligand, encapsulated PDT and imaging agents (Nanomedicine, 2011; PLOSOne, 2012). The selected nanoparticles are favourable to a photosensitizer targeting strategy for iPDT combined with MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) (Theranostics, 2012). The experimental values of µa and µs of the tumor tissue were introduced into a model of light propagation for animals with intracranial tumors treated by iPDT. This model of light distribution demonstrates that the absorption and diffusion coefficients influence strikingly photons propagation into the tumor volume and moreover we highlight the importance of the diffuser localization for therapy efficiency, especially to treat tumor thickness greater than 2mm. After intravenous injection of the multifunctional nanoparticles into rats with intracranial glioblastoma, we demonstrated a positive contrast enhancement of the tumor tissue by MRI, allowing the optimization of the optical fiber implantation. iPDT response was assessed by MR imaging, perfusion and diffusion weighted MRI, and MRS, illustrating the influence of the fiber positioning for a good light propagation into the tumor volume. Days of progression free survival were related to a hypoperfusion of the tumor tissue, an increase of apparent coefficient diffusion, and a modification in metabolite profile such as the increase of lactate.","authors":[{"name":"Magali  Toussaint","ids":["46524216"]},{"name":"Magalie  Thomassin","ids":["145879431"]},{"name":"Marine  Amouroux","ids":["3421583"]},{"name":"Ernest  Galbrun","ids":["31735778"]},{"name":"Walter  Blondel","ids":["3114035"]},{"name":"Thierry  Bastogne","ids":["145321322"]},{"name":"Muriel  Barberi-Heyob","ids":["1398654926"]}],"inCitations":["0214b8ce9cfe03e089ef68c21fece38773ac0805","2af91779c7b7a2f79523961cc65fd06fa32b2e93","28f2c3a8498f93c1f221ab44cc46f388e70a4a6c","754d79e0d5653ecf1fe177ac7f4f500bbe3ae1de","42eab837368ee8797fa4a8586da38ed996371117"],"outCitations":[],"year":2012,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a31da408969212375d2356aa661826634946a297","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"2612723609","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"5d799e097d8f9b91a509bce2ebb98a04006c0c24","title":"Multi-class Probabilistic Atlas-Based Segmentation Method in Breast MRI","paperAbstract":"Organ localization is an important topic in medical imaging in aid of cancer treatment and diagnosis. An example are the pharmacokinetic model calibration methods based on a reference tissue, where a pectoral muscle delineation in breast MRI is needed to detect malignancy signs.

The atlas consists of 5 structures (fatty and dense tissues, heart, lungs and pectoral muscle). It has been used in a Bayesian segmentation framework to delineate the mentioned structures.

Overall, a Dice Similarity Coefficient value of 0.8 has been obtained which shows the validity of our approach to Breast MRI segmentation.","authors":[{"name":"Albert  Gubern-Mérida","ids":["1398964823"]},{"name":"Michiel  Kallenberg","ids":["1766107"]},{"name":"Robert  Marti","ids":["144733375"]},{"name":"Nico  Karssemeijer","ids":["1745574"]}],"inCitations":["0c2d0d113dca4563d3f91ce6a8e0621c9095ff51","38cf23a932a90a8a385f787fcd85828ee021d9b3","e0380953c7a072144d119f255580ea032b2a153b","ba1ff4c608501fd4c5aece20106b11bcc8d13f96","dab915d81eeaa8a7b3829d6b98c2030a8c3c31cd","d951122438af133af6e1ed4bb418fdc6b112acc1","788ec7b9fb992a4e06ac86d601f6abf892b103a6","77c61d108c060b994a1eeaaa0d310078d06d84b8","9a52ae22fe11055656842be9a8450bfa3c241382","1319df0b2bfee20d1cb67232dfdb0dc3e3236d4e","452c9130dbf7aa0ffd7399fda5907ba4109f2723","f3d4d33bcffc2aa9bca814778b11e5a2727a9cfe","441ba6d8e7c9c7f2eac20ac0dfcb9e716d231328","962fede6c5a99283a61653c59214fb7d4d291b92","b2bba2b08347ca61f913aa14e881e330ffc2b600","69be93e79fb9f975389b0002056dc8824294e238","88c2b39f3e80f1a939bcdfc1c6aaeef8c6063139","b27903a1df52278d045568e7c5745ca22e5870dc","b6d06bb8c533716878b6f61fe8f28d092a2a4e26","12f7d0dcf62926ae1607c3474a371fe6cc606820"],"outCitations":["acd2e0ba8ac0fce8116c359a68db24d0e42ecb58","272c685823a8df4fa075a6a240983571114f8a3d","99f6643014df5ea1e97391718fd8d44fb3715000","b2ee272e8ec0e60dead4a4fc1ffbdd324c343d8d","7259aff35d9adb4b8f5a6db4535168d60fdc1415","b86d68e2e3013c77a3a2832935645bf134818b66","0ea655e5dd94e51e3658e006318844d2524927da","a99f1f749481e44abab0ba9a8b7c1d3572a2e465","f4fde3b789ddd4542ff050c09977f5beb826f05c","f900f21f960b334907d1d54783927922fc949c98","ec3c3f23157c784b9dc56c8209c59d98f63cd192","9f129b866e4ac0ea2cdcd254c3f38f695a876db1","b75ff2b9b67d7eaa6d0ef3231b755cde8f6915b7","62bff062c7e84ec4a60e0f416df1051976a7e744","2d7883451f7642b70c24126a55993bda05a5f916"],"year":2011,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5d799e097d8f9b91a509bce2ebb98a04006c0c24","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://eia.udg.edu/~agubern/pdfs/AGubernMerida_IbPRIA2011.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21257-4_82"],"venue":"IbPRIA","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"660-667","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-21257-4_82","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21257-4_82","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"102444427","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"846a0a7b8d2c96e9381f729dc2f1ff5f77b27738","title":"SDResU-Net: Separable and Dilated Residual U-Net for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation.","paperAbstract":"BACKGROUND\nGlioma is one of the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors that endanger human health. Tumors segmentation is a key step in assisting the diagnosis and treatment of cancer disease. However, it is a relatively challenging task to precisely segment tumors considering characteristics of brain tumors and the device noise. Recently, with the breakthrough development of deep learning, brain tumor segmentation methods based on fully convolutional neural network (FCN) have illuminated brilliant performance and attracted more and more attention.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this work, we propose a novel FCN based network called SDResU-Net for brain tumor segmentation, which simultaneously embeds dilated convolution and separable convolution into residual U-Net architecture. SDResU-Net introduces dilated block into a residual U-Net architecture, which largely expends the receptive field and gains better local and global feature descriptions capacity. Meanwhile, to fully utilize the channel and region information of MRI brain images, we separate the internal and inter-slice structures of the improved residual U-Net by employing separable convolution operator. The proposed SDResU-Net captures more pixel-level details and spatial information, which provides a considerable alternative for the automatic and accurate segmentation of brain tumors.\n\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION\nThe proposed SDResU-Net is extensively evaluated on two public MRI brain image datasets, i.e., BraTS 2017 and BraTS 2018. Compared with its counterparts and stateof- the-arts, SDResU-Net gains superior performance on both datasets, showing its effectiveness. In addition, cross-validation results on two datasets illuminate its satisfying generalization ability.","authors":[{"name":"Jianxin  Zhang","ids":["49051436"]},{"name":"Xiaogang  Lv","ids":["9279097"]},{"name":"Qiule  Sun","ids":["27097994"]},{"name":"Qiang  Zhang","ids":["39900385"]},{"name":"Xiaopeng  Wei","ids":["1706625"]},{"name":"Bin  Liu","ids":["14486508"]}],"inCitations":["7cac7ed92ad6db6e790dd036e9a266fbc7a7b338","ee3fa3b73f5b165218c6822c8bb0b23dde77bb2c","835a6f1bce676459e8d46508e64c4884142cd5ac"],"outCitations":["441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","26f6115a3fa63816779faf1180e27ba8a8f9bb63","c9f95d9c3633e34407d4438f885825356195c3a7","eb42cf88027de515750f230b23b1a057dc782108","d6f2f611da110b5b5061731be3fc4c7f45d8ee23","b735e9284fa26d8080362e3f86e988fc8ad1c583","97efa3acd4a45b28f3c9e25c961a9379abdc811b","b1a507a7efb3ab49816b689d822352a9d14b4a25","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","e0067a9c3f30aab46d9e6f8844dc36e83c85869f","d54134dd0ee1000c5eef6a8298f446b0a122b76a","1e17cc9d319f5dc886bf1382acaf3318de9b2e7f","c01f6960618c9b357832d6d654c6bc2af4c90b84","a63d0576a8ebbb2ddeef6b84f86311c87ba0cdac","9923c5d309a726774418306f4a34b0b4fc17493b","976050a0d225313224bd74f1608d20c5ac35577f","1366991fca32ed0f957f929cd893bd3e024bc611","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","317aee7fc081f2b137a85c4f20129007fd8e717e","ca5c766b2d31a1f5ce8896a0a42b40a2bff9323a","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","ff2b2b7b3f3657c1bb49c71605a162ed7f062e24","21ba757bf394720e0b66b86e7638ae28742d6570","e1ec11a1cb3d9745fb18d3bf74247f95a6663d08","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","7c2bcf6f32b05a04cd3444c030db743e5666af88","ec622c89e01eb52e2db806056133ec665564d7f4","f76d5a02d00ebb86447e68199993f80dc9bc62fd","420f3f1078a6d8e0696572c032877079286051c6"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/846a0a7b8d2c96e9381f729dc2f1ff5f77b27738","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Current medical imaging","journalName":"Current medical imaging","journalVolume":"16 6","journalPages":"\n          720-728\n        ","doi":"10.2174/1573405615666190808105746","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405615666190808105746","pmid":"32723244","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2967949483","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a213c8039b4508bb35acbe84dd545e3e2a30c0e1","title":"Skull-Stripping MR Brain Images Using Anisotropic Diffusion Filtering and Morphological Processing","paperAbstract":"The traditional methods for MRI image skull-stripping are not precise .Aiming at this problem, this paper develops method based on Anisotropic Diffusion Filtering and Morphological Processing. Firstly, it uses Anisotropic Diffusion Filter to smoothes noisy regions in the image. Secondly, the edge detector is used to locate the anatomical boundaries. Lastly, the task of the morphological processor is to select the pixel corresponding to the brain tissue from the original image. The results show that this method can segment brain precisely. The experiments show that this method can segment the brain and non-brain precisely, realize skull-stripping. I. INTRODUCTION Magnetic Resonance Image is primarily a medical imaging technique most commonly used in radiology to visualize the internal structure and function of the body. MRI provides much greater contrast between the different soft tissues of the body than computed tomography (CT) does, making it especially useful in neurological (brain), musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and cancer imaging. Unlike CT, it uses no ionizing radiation, but uses a powerful magnetic field to align the nuclear magnetization of hydrogen atoms in water in the body. Radio frequency fields are used to systematically alter the alignment of this magnetization, causing the hydrogen nuclei to produce a rotating magnetic field detectable by the scanner. This signal can be manipulated by additional magnetic fields to build up enough information to construct an image of the body. The skull stripping is concerned with the predominant tissues of the brain: grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). And it is often performed using a sequence of mathematical morphological operations following an initial separation of the brain from other tissues of the head. Our procedure consists of main three steps. First, the MRI is processed with an anisotropic diffusion filter to smooth non- essential gradients. And then we apply a Marr-Hildreth edge detector to the filtered image to identify important anatomical boundaries. These boundaries are identified and refined using a sequence of morphological and connected component operations.","authors":[{"name":"Jingjing  Gao","ids":["48441292"]},{"name":"Mei  Xie","ids":["144917416"]}],"inCitations":["0645fbeaa2f83b5778b78e354f2dd2c94a67a9d9","8814467aef5ac9fbc923f9d8e411434c902804d5","4c48b0e0be690096657884f5f9402122b6ce9ad8","2a2ac4df1fe2e1817210e793c705f3a9a4a4a9aa","b33152969befc15b9382d6bb39c92fa01ad8fb1e","5d7bc7d37491dfaada498781e55a2392de243179","1b3abcbae93889cee4343276a0b340b26c1dd133","2c098a62124af589c4dd5f1d71c89b2f498ba89e","eb44a87b8eddc87cb9de1942fcbf5957f4a84e83","09861affcb761af1160a1551ce16ff8e91c50ba2","4e0d351df4d2adf98320bb7fa458c5a1f98559cc","ad39da460db1594a701dbdfd7c4abf85c85ba1f5","6c7429651f2bbb8ab173333826b613c82a645534","ad20a021d09e40312cd4b888ef22ce1ddff11e3e","d0105e941475da178acaa1a990aeeef0ee6628fe","b2644e9ebca7c23399ff4fb31539406f320196cc","33fd78aa3806684cf2886984afa74695a7c7e2d0"],"outCitations":["03637599a4b7f3fd91874d70ffb0a3bc7974ea07","496c3d75b81b336411e53da1ac632a8139655604"],"year":2009,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a213c8039b4508bb35acbe84dd545e3e2a30c0e1","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2009 International Symposium on Computer Network and Multimedia Technology","journalName":"2009 International Symposium on Computer Network and Multimedia Technology","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-4","doi":"10.1109/CNMT.2009.5374500","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNMT.2009.5374500","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2164634414","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"ae5323091ea0d5b68e2d182b84d1248d2dfa2271","title":"Deep and Statistical Learning in Biomedical Imaging: State of the Art in 3D MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation","paperAbstract":"Clinical diagnostic and treatment decisions rely upon the integration of patient-specific data with clinical reasoning. Cancer presents a unique context that influence treatment decisions, given its diverse forms of disease evolution. Biomedical imaging allows noninvasive assessment of disease based on visual evaluations leading to better clinical outcome prediction and therapeutic planning. Early methods of brain cancer characterization predominantly relied upon statistical modeling of neuroimaging data. Driven by the breakthroughs in computer vision, deep learning became the de facto standard in the domain of medical imaging. Integrated statistical and deep learning methods have recently emerged as a new direction in the automation of the medical practice unifying multi-disciplinary knowledge in medicine, statistics, and artificial intelligence. In this study, we critically review major statistical and deep learning models and their applications in brain imaging research with a focus on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation.

chemoradiotherapy as a potential monitor for therapeutic efficiency of treatment for brain metastases from lung cancer were discussed.MethodThirty lung cancer patients with brain metastases, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) were performed one week before chemoradiotherapy and after one treatment cycle and two treatment cycles. 43 tumor lesions were divided into effective group and invalid group according to the changes of the tumor size. The differences in ADC values at different time points before and after treatment in each treatment group were analyzed.ResultThe maximum diameter of the tumor was no difference after one treatment cycle, but decreased after two treatment cycles. ADC values significantly increased after both one and two treatment cycles. In effective group, the ADC values were significantly increased after one and two treatment cycles. While, there are no difference in invalid group after one treatment cycle but decreased after two treatment cycles. ΔADC values in effective group after one and two treatment cycles were both significantly higher than those in the invalid group. ROC curve analysis then revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of ΔADC after one treatment was 0.872.ConclusionADC values in brain metastases from lung cancer can help monitor and dynamically observe the therapeutic efficiency of whole brain chemoradiotherapy.","authors":[{"name":"Kai  Liu","ids":["49599759"]},{"name":"Zenglin  Ma","ids":["6995256"]},{"name":"Lili  Feng","ids":["47009940"]}],"inCitations":["f817d8576f0728b1fc2690a93bc4fbbe7066f6bc","16ce35e01ab28059a8239f3cca4de583386a047e","98f97f6efb44f3445978b402d6823c984a81a2b0","7fcfe32f38b3bdbf1bfb9dde4ed9be5240b1ab10","a67a58c05f9b759afe684ac8eb02bc3a927c6e43"],"outCitations":["dc31750ffc79358bdba9982c6768509ca08141b6","577049d524b0a79f8e4ad9e6be1b075a6603a70f","69e66e118fa8e563f6e200b00c0a674a02241d80","7ad726c911c10e1a37fd4c2864c2f34fb9eececc","5aa7ca3b497ef11a2e58e7a355f4371fd1d9558c","caf333d2b8493b6d71b1d9171205b04cbdbe1d53","7b3ba49e6ee270cc13677a20de1daf47817943e7","637b609c3882ced96ebfea5c2d71c8885a2987f6","abb0794a0b5701191a819ce005d5020247fb5275","522d9cd9f720c7a71e2cb795f3a6c6d78ed1b144","d2b2f2b1a686ed51b0e0089aae7aa8ddb3a739d0","5d0106b7895de387658a7f4238915c0082fee3d9","d7a8ea7ab7e5758734b0e3fae238282e77a49416","523c8243e2933e0c0ee28150273c59f14d19fb22","f56d01b8ae5686b6715468705f425b32fb29b262","c795c97f57e3e90b9dd2a7f34f39f9fe6c75d55f","4bb42525ca63678eb0c93b212fcc4e34aab6551a","6df942a9a8457f3479a7d0ef7c2304bc41683da1","feb210ed7a21ecf92bc175062d25c9808a5d5efc","d22301207e1118db4c974bd3294279dbc90dc548","515c705dcf6f4b7fd5fa1f8c922130500334ea3d","d9d1dbc182272a41e9fca4aed8682def233e2f9a","15a2514615f203638bc0f7b1b99f15d98251c06f","55eabdafd14970d79365bed23c5144699a2f7501","80fc6768c6a2dd8500ff6eea40565ab72e72693d","c6f8e5b26ca8ed73f0f2c6279a8a3016d4b738d4","0f313a55c8b86d75fea3fbcd3a2aba24bd976887","19849e9478c326bd2bfba5bc102267a2367f39da","ff2c66855a5c9df26eb9effef43de03f8083926c","0bab1dc860fd9bab94d661ff9824eb9d3dfe02fe","5d3faadbfa51310df3cf23ee5cc7b92f6e847e60","021d6a62f7f6a6f05d3f66c2c2a42f7fd6aa1dcc","0b2d7fd6fecd4e73007a4397d0972dea7154b4dd","5bb7122e8c361798d43097d08ef687a2d6f57261","573491217c02ee81433860a4b6b13f032a8d107b","5cf9d11a931b26b814f40ef072e603a8cb4fa94d","dcaa140ec9b58aa23aaa56b1ed704b5389a24df8","a455f76f417925a75635b8279cabbd89b72c1d18","9a94f28368b6dd81b8e0d69a9db26ef7994803fa","e95bce28f5c328b66ed04d596fb7466cf8ac17f8","9deb95d9ee845286b3d16c809d14d5588f6f4c03","10e1c02e7cb3580341b238b7bc490604bc13f8f6"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/98246711416ce58ff0618e25597ab13d5fb6fabf","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q58733006","https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12880-018-0275-3"],"venue":"BMC Medical Imaging","journalName":"BMC Medical Imaging","journalVolume":"18","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1186/s12880-018-0275-3","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-018-0275-3","pmid":"30223786","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Computer Science"],"magId":"2891391491","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"9ad04a6f6444b46edecd07409d723f8ac6cff702","title":"Synthesize CT from paired MRI of the same patient with patch-based generative adversarial network","paperAbstract":"In current clinical practice, paired computed tomography (CT) providing electron density information for dose calculation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) providing molecular information for GTV delineation are acquired during radiation therapy planning of head cancer. Aimed to reduce repeatedly scanning procedures, we developed a patch-based deep learning approach to generate synthetic CT from paired MRI of the same patient. In this approach, 2D slices of MRI and CT would be divided into several overlap patches and sent to cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for training with a combination of multiple loss functions. For comparison, we also applied CycleGAN and pix2pix model using whole 2D slices as input. With IRB approval, a total number of 2542 paired MRI and CT images were collected in the experiment. Mean absolute error (MAE) and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) were used as evaluation metrics. The result showed that our proposed model performed best on both whole brain areas. We also provided the difference map between synthetic and real CT to give a visual evaluation of our proposed model.","authors":[{"name":"Yan  Li","ids":["89843190"]},{"name":"Jun  Wei","ids":["144525884"]},{"name":"Zhenyu  Qi","ids":["46986298"]},{"name":"Ying  Sun","ids":["2108940955"]},{"name":"Yao  Lu","ids":["152999622"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["9fa3720371e78d04973ce9752781bc337480b68f","1a589343556ef05ffb25de4ed2af4e8da22aedd1","7cc076c3dd293544cf9280990b0be6cd74cc74ad","e8a5f27e7805f8de84ea008d59452ff864271696","6bd4169a457f498520613ae4e2382c1a1271f94a","ff17ba849d2a05db7d9d2e26d33caebba8bf3c54","36814dfafaf5ca7871eb5b5f3838db3cc1099389","3a46ef8a2f949023fefcba71bd195d0868a58768","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9ad04a6f6444b46edecd07409d723f8ac6cff702","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Medical Imaging","journalName":"","journalVolume":"11314","journalPages":"113143W - 113143W-6","doi":"10.1117/12.2551285","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2551285","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Engineering"],"magId":"3011790143","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"fed38d6b93a438151502ccdf8df6b993764b9052","title":"Diagnosis of Brain Tumors in MR Images Using Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms","paperAbstract":"Image clustering presents a hot topic that researchers have chased extensively. There is always a need to a promising clustering technique due to its vital role in further image processing steps. This paper presents a compelling clustering approach for brain tumors and breast cancer in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Driven by the superiority of nature-inspired algorithms in providing computational tools to deal with optimization problems, we propose Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) to present a clustering method for brain tumors and breast cancer. Evaluation clustering results of CSA and FPA were judged using two apposite criteria and compared with results of K-means, fuzzy c-means and other metaheuristics when applied to cluster the same benchmark datasets. The clustering method-based CSA and FPA yielded encouraging results, significantly outperforming those obtained by K-means and fuzzy c-means and slightly surpassed those of other metaheuristic algorithms.","authors":[{"name":"Malik  Braik","ids":["1837327"]},{"name":"Alaa  Sheta","ids":["2110752"]},{"name":"Sultan  Aljahdali","ids":["1964613"]}],"inCitations":["3542c22fe34ba6c3da16e3df7a7cea36e6e6aff9"],"outCitations":["5d2d66965f631c0936d1e705e9819ae3811c5535","b885c7425853b3b82e99332ae3553b105d804ca2","01117990cee1fcc7810f1aff7ae2d0b5d840883a","5de855f12d6939e1920f752b2c4c1e7a4f310cee","ae68948d2f0d2b4e9eb107f6af1d67066c0c6fdf","bf3a034df5086468537d04107ad4857dfcc79811","73967727f1ba8536ade3f05e285ab00ce19937e9","2f4cc7791d34fd5be4d3299580998424702794c4","04966e92c42c2e0e612b7fccf1855117afe055b2","0c62da8bddf3bb84660706b2166f6f9e0c98c83c","8b494d5a6c4bead14de244c4d11fc3b2ffe9fec9","94f32df65915ce1150ed21abc8c4bab822ca96ad","ac7afaa8610206af9436b3a936cbf24101949f59","6f58c8a378812fe930ba0dc1d6a2867cd8667187","81019cadef17a153b4f0ed984a274e9d0ead8a9d","79406a6ab651fd2d5399cb6530cf7163855be403","8976bb498b6dd7de0addda1159a8194556b8f050","4a17d7bd8b891e67b2ba4768fe3a513e3f0e1bf7"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fed38d6b93a438151502ccdf8df6b993764b9052","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"603-614","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-36778-7_66","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36778-7_66","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2993086296","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"86c8593e19130e445c76e6c5bb2d7d030b35aedb","title":"Brain Tumor Segmentation in MRI Sequences Using Autoencoders","paperAbstract":"Manually delineating brain tumor sub-locality in MR images is very time consuming, requires experienced annotators and has high inter-rater variability.

Compared to other imaging modalities (PET, SPECT, CT), current MRI research helps to further and better understand the inner mechanisms of the human body in a less invasive manner. In clinical neuroimaging, perfusion MRI is of spectacular importance to study cerebrovascular diseases and cancer. However, at the moment, there is no perfusion MRI sequence that allows for a complete, non-invasive and precise quantification of microvascular flow dynamics. This work focuses on the use of the recently introduced Flow Enhanced Signal Intensity method (FENSI) to characterize and quantify vasculature at capillary level, at high and ultra high magnetic field (7 and 17.2 tesla).For that purpose, the possible quantification of blood flux with FENSI is explored in vivo. The combination of flux quantification and flow-enhanced signal (compared to Arterial Spin Labeling) can make of FENSI an ideal method to characterize in a complete non-invasive way the brain microvasculature. After removal of magnetization transfer (MT) effects, the blood flow dynamics are studied with FENSI in a very aggressive and propagative rat brain tumor model: the 9L gliosarcoma. The objective is to assess whether FENSI is suitable for a longitudinal non-invasive characterization of microvascular changes associated with tumor growth. The results obtained with FENSI are compared with literature on 9L perfusion and immuno-histochemistry. In the first paper published on FENSI, a first glance was also casted on the potential of the flow enhanced technique when applied to fMRI. The results obtained at the time were contaminated by MT effects. With the implementation of a new MT-free FENSI technique, the possibility to map the brain cerebral functioning based on a quantitative physiological parameter (CBFlux) more directly related to neuronal activity than the usual BOLD signal is within reach. At ultra high field, the influence of different anesthetics on the rat brain microvascular network and BOLD contrast is also considered. After many developments around the FENSI technique, the method is compared to classical ASL and DSC perfusion MRI sequences.

A good recognized imaging system for cerebrum has been known as MR imaging which is a non-intrusive method. Brain tumor recognition from MRI picture is a prominent amongst the most difficult errands in today's medical imaging research. Magnetic Resonance Images are utilized to catch pictures of delicate tissues in human body. MRI is most proficient for the research of brain tumor recognition and classification as compared to other method. This is because of high contrast of soft tissues, high spatial resolution as well as it does not generate any baleful radiation. It is reliable and useful for fast detection and classification of brain cancer. To distinguish cerebrum tumor the key procedure should be called as picture division which is a prominent amongst the most essential and testing part of PC supported clinical indicative devices. In any case, manual segmentation is tiresome and subjected to between inter and intra-rater blunders hard to describe. Hence, precise self-loader or programmed strategies are required. In the present work, it is tried to suggest an automatic segmentation strategy exploiting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), with little 3 × 3 filter size. The utilization of little portions permits outlining a more profound design, other than having a constructive outcome against over fitting, given the fewer amount of weights in the system. Here the upgrade of this proposed framework is to enhance the information picture quality on the off chance where that has been in lesser quality. Spatial domain methods are utilized for accomplishing this upgrade procedure. This proposed efficient image segmentation framework provides better outcomes in Convolution Neural Networks.","authors":[{"name":"A.  Sankari","ids":["87028661"]},{"name":"S.

The low spatial resolution of PET imaging induces partial volume effect to PET images that biases quantification. A PET partial volume correction method is proposed using high-resolution, anatomical information from magnetic resonance images (MRI). The corrected PET is pursued by removing the convolution of PET point spread function (PSF) and by preserving edges present in PET and the aligned MR images. The correction is implemented in a Bayesian's deconvolution framework that is minimized by a conjugate gradient method. The method is evaluated on simulated phantom and brain PET images. The results show that the method effectively restores 102 ± 7% of the true PET activity with a size of greater than the full-width at half maximum of the point spread function. We also applied the method to synthesized brain PET data. The method does not require prior information about tracer activity within tissue regions. It can offer a partial volume correction method for various PET applications and can be particularly useful for combined PET/MRI studies.","authors":[{"name":"Hesheng  Wang","ids":["2970970"]},{"name":"Baowei  Fei","ids":["145051402"]}],"inCitations":["ed17352ef95b23c79509fd8d388444d7cc720d4f"],"outCitations":["7ddf4ab3f089d6e340b8d9112d2ec6e8b68df519","bca1372d2f8c0e1a26139d8bdfc23f188f79a494","b146faf8d6e0d0a014834692189680b9f1230a2c","fce27758b537315e8feeed3a6ac27297eb2f91b8","69ae9073fd7f0dbfeec147a311e8754755d300ef","047daeffbba20edc1c66796b8b8dde6aeb42c4ff","eac382cea53c3393050485ac6893b204d932eef9","451f4cb1e4ccfce5b485a840742afa3f47cb69bd","5ca78232e2159a9b91faacdfaa791416afd352b7"],"year":2009,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9ca562f1fcc993c972b412b3ea3ca24b0983c389","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://fei-lab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fei_2009_SPIE_Wang_MRI_Partial_volume_correction.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41844063","https://open.library.emory.edu/publications/emory:tv3hx/pdf/"],"venue":"Medical Imaging","journalName":"","journalVolume":"7259","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1117/12.812474","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.812474","pmid":"24386530","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science","Engineering","Medicine","Computer Science"],"magId":"2764689262","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"ab1688ddd4d3e6a7310eb38e531d93e05d3e10ad","title":"Medical Image Enhancement Using Histogram Processing and Feature Extraction for Cancer Classification","paperAbstract":"MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a technique used to analyze and diagnose the problem defined by images like cancer or tumor in a brain.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: As preprocessing stage is essential for better segmentation as it removes noise that makes images having similar qualities so that tumor area can be shown and extracted with great accuracy. An anisotropic diffusion filter with 8-connected neighborhood is employed for noise removal and Fast Bounding Box (FBB) for exactly showing tumor area on MRI images. Finally Support vector machine classifies the boundary and extracts the tumor from the MRI image. Findings: Brain tumor is the major cause of cancer deaths in human which is due to uncontrollable cells growth in brain portion. Prior detection, diagnosis and accurate healing of brain tumor are the primary work to prevent human death. Image segmentation can also be done in several approaches like thresholding, region growing, watersheds and contours. Specialists with their basic knowledge do manual segmentation, which is time consuming process, where this limitation can be overcome by our fully automatic proposed method. Employing of an isotropic diffusion filter with 8-connected neighborhood compare to 4-connected neighborhood results in considerable improvements in terms of lower identical error rates. Our proposed Fast Bounding Box (FBB) method is applied that exactly shows tumor area on MRI images and its central region is selected judiciously to have sample points required for functionality of one class SVM classifier training. To achieve optimal classification level there is necessity of SVM with optimum efficiency, so that we adapted Support vector machine that immediately stops its operation once all the points are separated. Application/Improvements: Segmented tumor obtained with precision are very useful for radiologists and specialists to had good idea of estimating tumor position and size with great dealt with ease and without any prior information.","authors":[{"name":"Bobbala  Sreedevi","ids":["47014601"]},{"name":"T.

The major limitation in this therapy is caused by asthenia of some drugs injected to the blood vessel to reach the main tissue of brain. There are three substrate obstacles that adjust molecular exchange in junction between blood and neurotic tissue or its steep spaces: the brain endothelium which makes blood-brain barrier (BBB), the arachnoids epithelium which makes intermediate substrate of meninges and the choroid plexus epithelium, which secretes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methods: In recent years, some significant researches showed that magnetic nanoparticles (through conjugation of iron oxide NPs with hydrophilic polymer coatings of dextran) can be administered for impressive systemic and territorial transfer of therapeutics to the CNS. Nanoparticles also have the potential to revolutionize conventional imaging techniques. Conventional epitomize condition lack the association of high delicacy and high spatial precision required for molecular imaging. Results: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has high resolution, but lacks sensitivity to molecular signals, while high sensitivity nuclear medicine modalities such as Individual photon ejaculation calculated tomography and position emission tomography (PET) provide superb sensitivity, at the cost of reduced spatial resolution. Using nanoparticles in some conditions such as MRI can amazingly enhance delicacy, presenting the potential for high resolution molecular imaging. MRI has high spatial resolution, is non-invasive in nature and offers multiplanar tomographic capabilities. Nanoparticles can be managed to have magnetized specifications that can be acquired by MRI at low condensations and at the same time include lingads which target specific molecules. Iron oxide nanoparticles have been widely researched for MRI, as there are several types, namely magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (α-Fe2O3), among which magnetite is very promising, because of its proven biocompatibility. For molecular imaging purposes, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) need to bind to a range of drugs, proteins, enzymes, antibodies, or other molecular targets. In conclusion, using magnetized nanoparticles as a drug delivering system is still determined by its biocompatibility and optional aiming to the favorable cell or tissue under the guidance of external magnetic field (MRI scanner). Conclusion: Advances in current technologies and the expansion of magnetized nanoparticles as medicine transfer device to transfer medicine to tumor hypoxic zones have fast tracked in the past decade and led to the development of various magnetic nanoformulations such as liposomes, metallic, and polymeric nanoparticles. This technology will not only minimize invasive methods, nut also decrease side effects to intact fiber which are two primary concerns in conventional cancer therapies. The field of magnetic drug delivery is still at infancy, and combination of better magnetized medicine transfer device and association of multifunctional ligands are being continuously investigated so as to carry it from the bench-top to the clinic. Until Then the worries about the omission and long term toxicity remain barriers to clinical entry.","authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Gharib.

This process is applied to enhance the quality of the image and also to decrease the predictability and redundancy. By the clear observation and analysis of the fused image, doctors can easily identify the exact position of tumor located in any part of the Brain. NSCT (Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform) technology is successful in producing an integrated and highresolution image in medical fusion. This technology is in accordance with the two concerning features in the medical image of CT (Computed Tomography) and the medical image of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Multiple images are taken from different dimensions of the brain to form a CT-MRI fused image. Otsu’s Thresholding is a non linear segmentation method which converts the Grayscale image into a Binary image. The fusion of Multi-modalities such as MRI and CT can be acquired by distinct imaging modalities which are Object Recognition and Feature Extraction. The most effective image resolution is a highly challenging problem in CT-MRI fusion. Its Phase and Magnitude errors are corrected by having a single dependant random noise distribution which can change each pixel value in MRI and CT fused image. This is predominantly important for the recognition and diagnosis of Tumor, cancer and other properties of tissues in Human Body. With the classification done by SVM, we found that it achieves the highest classification accuracy of 93%. This is proposed to detect if the tumor is Malignant or Benign.","authors":[{"name":"S.

In this work, we investigate the advantages of combining neural networks with the prior anatomical shape knowledge of the model-based segmentation of organs-at-risk for brain radiotherapy (RT) on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We train our boundary detectors using two different approaches: classic strong gradients as described in [4] and as a locally adaptive regression task, where for each triangle a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to estimate the distances between the mesh triangles and organ boundary, which were then combined into a single network, as described by [1]. We evaluate both methods using a 5-fold cross- validation on both T1w and T2w brain MRI data from sixteen primary and metastatic brain cancer patients (some post-surgical). Using CNN-based boundary detectors improved the results for all structures in both T1w and T2w data. The improvements were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for all segmented structures in the T1w images and only for the auditory system in the T2w images.","authors":[{"name":"Eliza  Orasanu","ids":["2361555"]},{"name":"Tom  Brosch","ids":["12710958"]},{"name":"Carri  Glide-Hurst","ids":["1398370694"]},{"name":"Steffen  Renisch","ids":["1980145"]}],"inCitations":["6365f00d1381f8a52cf3a54f21a078a919a81622","6518b197b005affb2a9068fc03579c16045a1005","8c3e7d2d6e3bc71eb6945a4ef010c07590b9796a"],"outCitations":["e294c98f63144b9c5c2ac7528322453027ad9f9b","a675d2559e6fc33e1a515557665504bb54317ae9","82bc105324d0132e14dbc713eae4539fc2f55c06","03be59c2693c40d7a1d22804edeec2c4cb41ce1e"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/98cb6ada4903f869477406e2d093b1034fe55c72","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q92058384"],"venue":"ShapeMI@MICCAI","journalName":"Shape in Medical Imaging : International Workshop, ShapeMI 2018, held in conjunction with MICCAI 2018, Granada, Spain, September 20, 2018, Proceedings.

Consequently, determining the correct type of brain tumor in early stages is of significant importance to devise a precise treatment plan and predict patient's response to the adopted treatment. In this regard, there has been a recent surge of interest in designing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the problem of brain tumor type classification. However, CNNs typically require large amount of training data and can not properly handle input transformations. Capsule networks (referred to as CapsNets) are brand new machine learning architectures proposed very recently to overcome these shortcomings of CNNs, and posed to revolutionize deep learning solutions. Of particular interest to this work is that Capsule networks are robust to rotation and affine transformation, and require far less training data, which is the case for processing medical image datasets including brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. In this paper, we focus to achieve the following four objectives: (i) Adopt and incorporate CapsNets for the problem of brain tumor classification to design an improved architecture which maximizes the accuracy of the classification problem at hand; (ii) Investigate the over-fitting problem of CapsNets based on a real set of MRI images; (iii) Explore whether or not CapsNets are capable of providing better fit for the whole brain images or just the segmented tumor, and; (iv) Develop a visualization paradigm for the output of the CapsNet to better explain the learned features.

images in pediatric oncology","paperAbstract":"Survival of pediatric patients with brain tumor has increased over the past 20 years, and increasing evidence of iatrogenic toxicities has been reported. In follow-ups, images are acquired at different time points where substantial changes of brain morphology occur, due to childhood physiological development and treatment effects. To address the image registration complexity, we propose two multi-metric approaches ( M plus , M dot ), combining mutual information (MI) and normalized gradient field filter (NGF). The registration performance of the proposed metrics was assessed on a simulated dataset (Brainweb) and compared with those obtained by MI and NGF separately, using mean magnitude and mean angular errors. The most promising metric ( M plus ) was then selected and tested on a retrospective dataset comprising 45 pediatric patients who underwent focal radiotherapy for brain cancer. The quality of the realignment was scored by a radiation oncologist using a perceived misalignment metric (PM). All patients but one were assessed as PM ≤ 2 (good alignment), but the remaining one, severely affected by hydrocephalus and pneumocephalus at the first MRI acquisition, scored PM = 5 (unacceptable). These preliminary findings suggest that M plus might improve the registration accuracy in complex applications such as pediatric oncology, when data are acquired throughout the years of follow-up, and is worth investigating.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently an indispensable diagnostic imaging technique for the early detection of any abnormal changes in tissues and organs. Brain tumors are the most aggressive and devastating types of cancer and therefore, its correct identification at an early stage followed by treatment is its only cure. In this project, a comparative study of transform techniques namely Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) each separately combined with the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is used for the classification of brain tumor. The system consists of three stages for the diagnosis of brain tumor. In the first stage, MR image is obtained and preprocessing is done to remove the noise and sharpen the image. In the second stage, DCT and DWT is used for feature extraction. In the third stage, Probabilistic Neural Network with Radial Basis Function distinguishes brains abnormality. Finally the performance of DCT and DWT in diagnosing the brain tumor is compared using the parameters such as sensitivity rate and precision rate.","authors":[{"name":"G.

Nowadays, one of the leading reasons of death is cancer. Some common cancers are breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, brain cancer, and so on. To save human lives from cancer, an effective and timely treatment is required. Many different types of image modalities like CT scan, ultrasound, x-ray, MRI can be used to determine the disease, but traditionally, this was purely dependent on the knowledge and experience of doctors. So, the death rate was quite high and increasing day by day. Machine learning and deep learning are providing robust solutions in this field. There are many deep learning techniques like RNN, CNN, DBN, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks which are providing robust solutions in cancer diagnosis and prognosis so that many human lives can be saved.

The ECVT sensor system measures the capacitance of electrical signals of the brain on the cortex, and generates a volumetric map of the brain activity on the cortex and inside the brain through a tomography image reconstruction algorithm based on a Neural-Network Multi-criteria Optimization Image Reconstruction Technique (NN-MOIRT). The ECVT is able to detect brain tumors through an examination of the brain functional abnormalities, as the tumors block the propagation of neuro-signals and cause abnormalities in the brain activity image. The ECVT sensor design has been optimized for the detection of the brain tumors in different sensitivity regions of the brain. Case studies have been carried out to five volunteers suffering from different brain tumors including ependymoma, oligodendroglioma, cranio-pharyngioma, germinoma pineal, and cerebellopontine angle tumors. Comparisons with their respective CT and MRI results have also been performed. The study has shown a great feasibility of the 4D imaging technique as a complementary alternative for a high speed non-radiation technique for brain cancer detection and functional imaging.","authors":[{"name":"Warsito P.

The system can freely revolve axially around the patient to deliver dose from any desired angle. For such a system, the radiation treatment planning procedure is expected to rely on the MR images only, i.e. MRI Simulation. Replacing the current CT/CT+MRI-based RTP procedure with MRI Simulation will eliminate the need for the planning CT scanning sessions (no additional x-ray exposure) and consequently the image fusion between MRI and planning CT. In this work, we propose a comprehensive MRI-based RTP procedure for an MRI-Linac system. Specifically, the method consists of a) data acquisition, b) analysis and correction of image artifacts caused by the scanner-related and patient-induced distortions, c) segmentation of organ structures relevant to dosimetric calculations (e.g. soft tissue, bone, air), d) conversion of MR images into CT-like images by assigning bulk electron density values to organ contours defined at step c), e) dose calculations in external magnetic field, and f) plan evaluation. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the linac-MRI scanner's magnetic field induced effects on the dose deposited patterns using patient data. Specifically, we investigated the dosimetric differences between the corresponding MRI-based RT plans simulated at zero and 0.2 T. We found that the maximum percent differences for brain studies were within 4%. Most of these differences occurred at the inferior field edge and superficially at beam exits.","authors":[{"name":"T  Stanescu","ids":["2632046"]},{"name":"C  Kirkby","ids":["6069872"]},{"name":"H  Jans","ids":["50221529"]},{"name":"K  Wachowicz","ids":["4556609"]},{"name":"S  Rathee","ids":["144622501"]},{"name":"M  Carlone","ids":["32917121"]},{"name":"B  Murray","ids":["145012134"]},{"name":"G  Fallone","ids":["10690649"]}],"inCitations":["db3d364e5303d5feed5aeacd9ac913b164085d45"],"outCitations":[],"year":2008,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e56da7ab27295816036c603fb6f3d9aca3f6db4","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Medical physics","journalName":"Medical physics","journalVolume":"35 7Part3","journalPages":"\n          3412\n        ","doi":"10.1118/1.2965974","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1118/1.2965974","pmid":"28512909","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science","Medicine"],"magId":"1998553368","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"ef3e5e4508f0a407d0e4646046d25dc926f7c94f","title":"Efficient Algorithm for the Detection of a Brain Tumor from an MRI Images","paperAbstract":"Medical image processing is considered as a very promising field due to its role in medical diagnoses of fatal diseases like cancers, with the availability of the advanced technology, detection of tumours has become easier nowadays.

In this paper an algorithm for accurate detection of brain tumours is proposed, and based on the result obtained, it gives more accurate detection of a brain tumour in comparison to other methods like K-cluster, watershed algorithm, and threshold selection method. The algorithm is based on the application of a specific formula that segments the image very efficiently and isolates the tumour from the skull and other brain tissues based on the solidity and area.

Generally noninvasive magnetic resonance image (MRI) data are taken as the input for the simulation. The topologic relationship of anatomy is extracted from MR images through segmentation processes. To accelerate the biological modeling phase, template surface and volume meshes are generated based on MR images and∕or anatomical atlases (e.g., brain atlas, etc.). The boundary surfaces are extracted from segmented regions on the image slices, which are used as the input for 3D volume mesh generation. An intuitive graphic user interface was developed for biomedical applications. It integrated MRI data manipulation with surface mesh and volume mesh generators. Image volume and mesh geometries are registered in the MRI working space. As the core component of the system, a robust 3D mesh generation approach is presented. It is capable of describing irregular geometries exhibiting concave and convex surfaces. It uses deltahedral building blocks for volume mesh generation and creates high-quality, regular-shaped tetrahedral mesh elements. The approach supports multiple levels of localized refinement without reducing the overall mesh quality. The validity of this new mesh generation strategy and implementation is demonstrated via the medical applications in brain vasculature modeling, multimodality imaging for breast cancer detection, and numerous anatomically accurate models presented. Multiple material boundaries are preserved in each mesh with fidelity.","authors":[{"name":"James Qingyang Zhang","ids":["2108020097"]},{"name":"John M.

Pathologists typically have to work through numerous pathology images that can be in the order of hundreds or thousands which takes time and is prone to manual error. Here we investigate automating this task given pathology images as well as 3D MRI volumes without lesion maps. We use data provided by the CPM-RadPath 2019 MICCAI challenge. We first evaluate accuracy on the validation dataset with MRI and pathology images separately. We predict the 3D tumor mask with our custom developed tumor segmentation model that we used for the BraTS 2019 challenge. We show that the predicted tumor segmentations give a higher validation accuracy of 77.1% vs. 69.8% with MRI images when trained by a 3D residual convolutional neural network. For pathology images we train a 2D residual network and obtain a 66.2% validation accuracy. In both cases we find high training accuracies above 95% which suggests overfitting. We propose a dual path residual convolutional neural network model that trains simultaneously from both MRI and pathology images and we use a simple method to prevent overfitting. One path of our network is fully 3D and considers 3D tumor segmentations as input while the other path considers pathology images. To prevent overfitting we stop training after 90% training accuracy at the epoch number where our network loss increases in the following one. With this approach we achieve a validation accuracy of 84.9% showing that indeed combining the two image sources yields a better overall accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"Yunzhe  Xue","ids":["50978850"]},{"name":"Yanan  Yang","ids":["2108605736"]},{"name":"Fadi G.

The technique, referred to as multi-attribute combined mutual information (MACMI), adopts a multivariate application of mutual information (MI) to allow several coregistered images to be represented as a single high dimensional multi-attribute image. Our approach improves scenarios involving registration of multiple images as it, (1) utilizes all aligned images obtained in earlier registration steps, (2) improves alignment accuracy compared with pairwise approaches that only consider two images (and hence a fraction of the available data) at a time, and (3) avoids complex optimization problems often associated with fully-groupwise methods. For example, if two coregistered volumes such as T2-weighted and PD-weighted MRI are to be aligned with PET, it is intuitively better to use information from both MR protocols instead of choosing one for registration with PET. In the automated elastic registration of 20 corresponding multiprotocol (T1, T2, PD) synthetic MRI images of the brain with known misalignment of PD MRI, MACMI showed significant improvement in terms of deformation field error over conventional MI-based pairwise registration (p ≪ 0.05). For a total of 108 corresponding whole-mount histology (WMH), T2 MRI, and DCE (T1) MRI images obtained from 17 prostate specimens with cancer, elastic registration of WMH to bothMRI protocols simultaneously was performed viaMACMI. Improved alignment in terms of prostate overlap and cancer localization was observed using MACMI, compared to pairwise registration of WMH to the individual T2 and DCE MR protocols.","authors":[{"name":"Jonathan  Chappelow","ids":["2439089"]},{"name":"Anant  Madabhushi","ids":["1705442"]}],"inCitations":["a85dcebf9a07ac267d269662b5635be6a2e952f4","5a7fa79f5c1628976bed6e0b331b3825294bebd6","c3fa12549bb6eefb9d0fcdb9d167282c0cbd39a3","1ccd458e780ae533c4cb0d80a920862f070b37d9","0745f29ee0db40617f7365bfa90279ea2fa70e1d","eeaf10c9031f06122296cd0b0091872871462fa8","f46340685b2a1bc1e52f4e3f1a23b3a63003d795"],"outCitations":["2c37792e0cbe4363caff54be87aaf080d21adfc6","0f097bf054d522792383e365efe3d59ad974f01f","2d76d3178f9afa55cd4c1fe25238b1467636a57e","3606624464d256e957bf0efba667c2a726f468c0","974709d1a74797957623fc72851ee339dbebecc2","6657603f3bce278d5b44800b44871d92f3dd0485","0ca1eef2b3c7228a30e58da3f2b21eac727d454d","22fc9ce73b266a59a603fd6669b5d21e1f681be2"],"year":2010,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0893cce7f76cd2927118544f7d2f300baba5a49a","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490330","http://engineering.case.edu/centers/ccipd/sites/ccipd.case.edu/files/publications/Multi-attribute-combined-mutual-information-(MACMI).pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anant_Madabhushi/publication/224147636_Multi-attribute_combined_mutual_information_(MACMI)_An_image_registration_framework_for_leveraging_multiple_data_channels/links/00b7d519e310763122000000.pdf"],"venue":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","journalName":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"376-379","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490330","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490330","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"1977126489","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a72b3cd9643a562dc8c6a05bdaeefdb147a1da22","title":"Network Curvature as a Hallmark of Brain Structural Connectivity","paperAbstract":"Studies show that while brain networks are remarkably robust to a variety of adverse events, such as injuries and lesions due to accidents or disease, they may be fragile when the disturbance takes place in specific locations. This seems to be the case for diseases in which accumulated changes in network topology dramatically affect certain sensitive areas. To this end, previous attempts have been made to quantify robustness and fragility of brain functionality in two broadly defined ways: (i) utilizing model-based techniques to predict lesion effects, and (ii) studying empirical effects from brain lesions due to injury or disease. Both directions aim at assessing functional connectivity changes resulting from structural network variations. In the present work, we follow a more geometric viewpoint that is based on a notion of curvature of networks, the so-called Ollivier-Ricci curvature. A similar approach has been used in recent studies to quantify financial market robustness as well as to differentiate biological networks corresponding to cancer cells from normal cells. The same notion of curvature, defined at the node level for brain networks obtained from MRI data, may help identify and characterize the effects of diseases on specific brain regions. In the present paper, we apply the Ollivier-Ricci curvature to brain structural networks to: i) Demonstrate its unique ability to identify robust (or fragile) brain regions in healthy subjects. We compare our results to previously published work which identified a unique set of regions (called structural core) of the human cerebral cortex. This novel characterization of brain networks, complementary to measures such as degree, strength, clustering or efficiency, may be particularly useful to detect and monitor candidate areas for targeting by surgery (e.g. deep brain stimulation) or pharmaco-therapeutic agents; ii) Illustrate the power our curvature-derived measures to track changes in brain connectivity with healthy development/aging and; iii) Detect changes in brain structural connectivity in people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) which are in agreement with previous morphometric MRI studies.","authors":[{"name":"Hamza  Farooq","ids":["50093273"]},{"name":"Yongxin  Chen","ids":["2369515"]},{"name":"Tryphon T.

It facilitates the automatic interpretation or diagnosis that helps in surgical planning, estimating the changes in the brain’s volume for various types of tissues, and recognizing different neural disorders. Many neurological disorders like epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, tumor, and cancer can be effectively quantified and analyzed by finding the volume of the brain tissues such as White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM), and Cerebro Spinal Fluids (CSF). In manual segmentation of brain MRIs physicians manually determines the boundaries of different objects of interest and it is time-consuming and difficult. Thus, several accurate automatic brain MRI segmentation techniques with different levels of complexity have been proposed. This paper proposes an advanced thresholding technique for the segmentation of brain MRIs based on the biologically inspired Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. Here the texture features are assumed as heuristic data.

Previous attempts to quantify robustness and fragility sought to understand how the functional connectivity of brain networks is affected by structural changes, using either model-based predictions or empirical studies of the effects of lesions. We advance a geometric viewpoint relying on a notion of network curvature, the so-called Ollivier-Ricci curvature. This approach has been proposed to assess financial market robustness and to differentiate biological networks of cancer cells from healthy ones. Here, we apply curvature-based measures to brain structural networks to identify robust and fragile brain regions in healthy subjects. We show that curvature can also be used to track changes in brain connectivity related to age and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and we obtain results that are in agreement with previous MRI studies. The brain can often continue to function despite lesions in many areas, but damage to particular locations may have serious effects. Here, the authors use the concept of Ollivier-Ricci curvature to investigate the robustness of brain networks.","authors":[{"name":"Hamza  Farooq","ids":["50093273"]},{"name":"Yongxin  Chen","ids":["2369515"]},{"name":"Tryphon T.

Performing an automatic segmentation is a defying task since different forms of tumor tissue exist for diverse patients and in many cases the tumor is similar to the normal tissue. Various studies proposed earlier to handle the issue of precisely segmenting the tumor but they discard the degradations and their effect to the precision of the segmentation. This article provides a more precise segmentation process through the use of appropriate pre-processing algorithms. The authors studied many enhancement and restoration algorithms and selected the NL-means, Laplacian filter and histogram equalization to be used as preprocessing techniques. Experimental results showed that using a suitable preprocessing scheme would produce a better segmentation process.

INTRODUCTION A tumor is a mass of tissue that grows out of control of the normal forces that regulates growth. Brain tumor has a higher mortality rate when compared to more common types of cancer. This underlines the need of accurate prognosis of brain tumor in health care industry [1]. MRI has become a widely-used method of high-quality medical imaging, especially in brain imaging [2]. Image segmentation refers to the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments, also known as super pixels. Image segmentation is an important process in computer vision and image processing, which divides an image into a number of disjoint regions such that the pixels have high similarity in order to use its different fields; science, medical, agriculture and industrial fields [3]. Besides, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images are known to be corrupted by noise [4], blur [5] and low contrast artifact [6]. Therefore, this article discusses the issue of achieving a better segmentation through the use of proper image restoration and enhancement techniques. Moreover, the accurate and automatic segmentation of a brain tumor on MRI image is of great interest for assessing tumor growth and treatment responses, enhancing computer-assisted surgery, and constructing tumor growth models [7]. For those reasons, an automatic and reliable tumor segmentation method would be a useful tool since the medical image segmentation plays an instrumental role in clinical diagnosis [8]. The rest of the article sections are organized as the following: in section two, a brief elucidation about some related studies is presented as the used literature review. Moreover, detailed explanations about the employed algorithms are delivered in section three as a methodology. Also, the results of the proposed methodology are illustrated in section four as the experimental results. Likewise, a detailed discussion about the use of certain algorithms and its results is deliberated in section five. Finally, a brief closure about this article is provided in section six as a conclusion. II. LITERATURE REVIEW In this section, three recent studies are briefly described. The first study was presented by [9] which proposed a texture based analysis to identify irregularity in the brain and automatic segmentation using seeded region growing segmentation. The method of tumor detection based on the texture of the MRI is proposed to segment the abnormality from the regular adjacent, although small quantities misclassified, but the segmentation result is precise. Moreover, [10] suggested a strong technique for automatic detection of tumor for brain MRI images. He also proposed a new morphological technique which is used for the stripped skull region from the brain images. Detecting tumor precisely based on seeded region growing segmentation on an improved single seed point selection algorithm is","authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Basil Al-Othman","ids":["1409080424"]},{"name":"Zohair  Al-Ameen","ids":["1402538139"]},{"name":"Ghazali  Sulong","ids":["2529988"]}],"inCitations":["fb4e82fa01229a8aa2d97a0987e63f4b2ac8fcdc","9025be982565fda1e5b5b2319552dae116138a8b"],"outCitations":["3f0c0139eeb72d65a0b5af9bbee79c5b8d13bbc5","879fc413ebc138db1121fa5ab93b230205a4c1a6","97335187f39a2da2a1b7bca47644fefefb1a88bf","29beba25c2ce57968655cd47b9b41e47600ba5e3","ff00d17b70e1081066a6932ffd9befedf4815612","8e76c9a23920c46aae4bd4ea0c34742f218580bc","6d39b8a8e0e24a4d6f74ba877db80d386122adad","50f6a983c409bbe9adca343a906b70628518a7dc","0051597bba626d59b0b37d7364202638712225c8","e32291e02b4df3fcae21cbd17c20ca6a536b5c95","1c4b77b98f8f443b340deb2ecf36ec901f3cd677","e6e2a625d4038ee63c99f3b87dd00e4399a6ae69","63cec1177857f74201ca8b885e2ac0f637b5e292","a6aa4552f2187447853425d0b91a94b19f2f3059","e0158242295f7642fafc9970226cf5f00d35cbb3","57af38c8304e1a4add086c923fe417055f6164c1","f47346f1e98aa1589265fc273cb6098691dfecca","c4b475e2281211f8f63ee9db48d5d665e91b8041","544e0a29b8d07979502067ceadd5e8980c4504ca","9c842b2926fd60b9e6ff80fee28c65e7c1ae5f1d","4c881f2e52a2f84cfab7141b5cfd8a58ecb091cf","e6940af3146119322659820bc16201e84009f7f5","f9aa29c84e9d5071c968cc3d96f67267743d98d2"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e7ca88a7839334d78ae31b3147be10175b2e0c3","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zohair_Al-Ameen/publication/259474465_Improving_the_MRI_Tumor_Segmentation_Process_Using_Appropriate_Image_Processing_Techniques/links/00b7d52bfb86a4eb97000000.pdf","http://www.mecs-press.org/ijigsp/ijigsp-v6-n2/IJIGSP-V6-N2-3.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Image, Graphics and Signal Processing","journalVolume":"6","journalPages":"23-29","doi":"10.5815/IJIGSP.2014.02.03","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5815/IJIGSP.2014.02.03","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2157147311","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"7cae4ec1b8b03193fefb8af1c6351d23aca38c5d","title":"Computer aided diagnosis of brain tumor using novel classification techniques","paperAbstract":"Brain cancer treatment mainly depends on the accurate detection of the tumor type, location, size and borders. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) can be used to analyze the properties of the desired region such as tissues and tumors with automated and semi-automated approaches. So, the extraction of MRI brain tumor image is a challenging task in medical image processing. The major problems associated with MRI analysis by a physician are time consuming and the accuracy depends on the expertise of the physician.This limitation can be overcome by the computer aided diagnosis (CAD) technology. In this paper, a CAD system is designed to detect brain tumors with computer assistance using T1 and T2 weighted MR images. The designed system classifies the tumor into benign or malignant from MR Image using a novel automated method which increases the performance and reduces the complexity involved in the tumor diagnosis. The CAD system has four stages such as image acquisition, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Segmentation is done with the help of K-means clustering, which enhances the medical image and the clustering quality to avoid local optima and to find global optima. The feature extraction is performed by gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The tumor classification is done using support vector machine (SVM) and bag of visual words (BOVW) classifiers. The test result of the SVM classifier gives accuracy 95.0%, sensitivity 91.79% and specificity 94.75%. Whereas, the BOVW classifier yields results of accuracy 96.0%, sensitivity 90.0% and specificity 100%. This result shows that, the designed system classifies the tumor into benign or malignant with a good level of accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"Jasmine  Paul","ids":["2072791579"]},{"name":"T. S.

Use of computerized techniques helps the doctors for the diagnosis and treatment against brain cancer. In this article, an automated system is developed for tumor extraction and classification from MRI. It is based on marker‐based watershed segmentation and features selection. Five primary steps are involved in the proposed system including tumor contrast, tumor extraction, multimodel features extraction, features selection, and classification. A gamma contrast stretching approach is implemented to improve the contrast of a tumor. Then, segmentation is done using marker‐based watershed algorithm. Shape, texture, and point features are extracted in the next step and high ranked 70% features are only selected through chi‐square max conditional priority features approach. In the later step, selected features are fused using a serial‐based concatenation method before classifying using support vector machine. All the experiments are performed on three data sets including Harvard, BRATS 2013, and privately collected MR images data set. Simulation results clearly reveal that the proposed system outperforms existing methods with greater precision and accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad A Khan","ids":["18947121"]},{"name":"Ikram U

Concurrent Estimation of Perfusion and Microvascular Permeability","paperAbstract":"This work introduces a model-based, high-definition dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI for concurrent estimation of perfusion and microvascular permeability over the whole brain. A time series of reference-subtracted signals is decomposed into one component that reflects main contrast dynamics and the other one that includes residual contrast agents (CA) and background signals. The former is described by linear superposition of a finite number of basic vectors trained from an augmented set of data that consists of tracer-kinetic model driven signal vectors and patient-specific measured ones. Contrast dynamics is estimated by solving a constrained optimization problem that incorporates the linearized signal decomposition into the measurement model of DCE MRI and then combining the main component with the background-suppressed, residual CA signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that prospectively enables rapid temporal sampling with 1.5 s (3 ∼ 4 times higher than clinical routines) while simultaneously achieving high isotropic spatial resolution with 1.0 mm3 (4 ∼ 6 times higher than routines), enhancing estimation of both patient-specific inputs and outputs for quantification of microvascular functions. Simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in patients with brain cancer.","authors":[{"name":"Joon Sik Park","ids":["2116652077"]},{"name":"Eunji  Lim","ids":["2111721937"]},{"name":"Seung-Hong  Choi","ids":["48919266"]},{"name":"Chul-Ho  Sohn","ids":["145457686"]},{"name":"Joonyeol  Lee","ids":["6988740"]},{"name":"Jaeseok  Park","ids":["46979152"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["76150d4601c900abdf6072f7172164276377ee08","cc6cd2d85a37be6b69adc67d242b676ae146650d","926339500985c79f0907bd1c9cd268d41a8aad75","9a08a1a6014b9919aad7a8fddc1c64733916e48d","c8df2b47783909bd3497f7b94bb52782f7fc8533","ccb518b25c2ec572c07254a1bd19ec06372ab4bd","25c84b85b041c5fd0ec3750095553ce37404fec7","bbc7fd25f8f3eb8ef61309d18176cf05fcc11d12","a79e019871750d3102b2b00e647c012fc0f39d19","a29a5bd41223b24a71893257df1df2197e152af4","179120f03b365f2a2c536e6284cc4d70db1a8a02","e67f5868a5080fe5101e4508eee784b4a8a57355","06601b730e5b28b07e3e6e7704fd825a47aa3c48","636ef0378332005ec8d8bdf6d2226ac321c02495","db0f7c24d0b8e1806f6cddace2872dffac900aab","7d71716cce189edbf19641bc3598e77628296a4f","c18643b160006a4733bce6b4d8fe8c6916244489","5fca0fd68162dddd5d797225ebbac4bcc7df1356","312121d1af0b4e6c856a2af53dab6b1c44a8f5c6","738e4c80bfce62ce824d205ad5e1d1c18d40ef58","18266393459cd7a8948d1512782bb830887a75c3","65afabfefa1270398b457f09f734070aa7ef176b","1c0ad3b19d524761274f5fb310d1e2e25d596eba","e6ac7976a5cf8b571c103fb99114287a48d0f56b","9a4b408f773fd359bdac6565fc586a5cfa8ccfed","316e2eceaf0a9e153ec111a9630029cc63b6d770","279047d3c351eb20f158656724844b6ded247ffc","c1cdaaa50362b6d1f91632d8eb9533cf233c417a","30c9d858078f2b6cf7d93c204492929d64edb5fe","ff49e482f6bc7bd7dba4999eb16d02e9741300e9","aec2debf3458ac0d73af8de9b220312f3673408a","1a270fb8c1f074ba6fa2f0180d7db7fa9783cf04","3c8e46ba40156f8b0f4ea94aa473aa60adcb402f","531944e793d1f68b93289a00e9952029fc573594","0854f854416a2f2a259cfb209c7572bb94a5ffdf","dbf46f76cc840f2ebe38930e16a8e42b49289aed","a35d565e8f70cb6ddc09a65904a72622e16b9485","9b3c993e18fcc5913abaf6ab75dd209cae458cb8","19d65ed6238270d5d5520b77436cd8214d269d4d","0c7b579a6736e4b60300d6c6a8347135c8b3565c","07e8a225a57544b3952eec54b16033424af4e140","95eea3e012613a1d5003dcf9971209fa9d41ef73","bf8255f55bcc71f93ee9941bb4f201f7b200dfa0","924ad7cce3e87c20ce8a64f297c1d0afee934555","e4a3c708d7a82cbe375a089133b6fbc2ee312347","5dcf955fa2f0930a57e689168ebf92a88db5010f","317300c8c7310fd9b7ac3f0bed8f82bc745a1848","afa76d9091717583d481d490e7ddfefd172bdeba","b5211bec45d0f23487795ee0c1a3d87a526de40b"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a72f3e4c1a8cd74da6c88575630e476784880ac3","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://pr.ibs.re.kr/bitstream/8788114/6680/1/1-s2.0-S1361841519301069-main.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q90875204"],"venue":"Medical Image Anal.","journalName":"Medical image analysis","journalVolume":"59","journalPages":"\n          101566\n        ","doi":"10.1016/j.media.2019.101566","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2019.101566","pmid":"31639623","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2979873180","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"f094fe5997d32ff827eb384c94ff76de664bc502","title":"MRI Fuzzy Segmentation of Brain Tumor with Fuzzy Level Set Optimization","paperAbstract":"Image segmentation is a task that is fundamental many image processing and computer vision applications. Due to the existence of noise, low contrast, and intensity in homogeneity, it really is still a difficult issue in majority of applications. One of the steps that are first way of understanding images is to segment them in order to find down different objects inside them. However, in real images such as MRI graphics, noise is corrupting the image information or image usually consists of textured sections. The images produced by MRI scans are frequently grey images with strength in the product range scale that is gray. The MRI image associated with the brain comprises of the cortex that lines the surface that is outside of brain additionally the gray nuclei deep inside of the mind including the thalami and basal ganglia. As Cancer may be the leading cause of death for all as the explanation for the condition remains unknown, very early detection and diagnosis is one of the keys to cancer control, and it will increase the success of treatment, save lives and reduce expenses. Health imaging is very often used tools which can be diagnostic detect and classify defects. To eliminate the dependence of the operator and increase the precision of diagnosis system aided diagnosis computer are a valuable and ensures that are advantageous the detection of cancer tumors and classification. Segmentation techniques based on gray level techniques such as for instance threshold and methods based on region are the easiest and find application that is restricted. However, their performance can be improved by incorporating them with the ways of hybrid clustering. practices based on textural characteristics atlas that is using look-up table can have very good results on the segmentation of medical pictures , however, they require expertise within the construction of the atlas Limiting the technical atlas based is that , in some circumstances , it becomes difficult to choose correctly and label information has difficulty in segmenting complex structure with variable form, size and properties such circumstances it is best to use unsupervised methods such as fuzzy algorithms. In this work we proposed a novel fuzzy based MRI Image Segmentation algorithm, Fuzzy Segmentation involves the task of dividing data points into homogeneous classes or clusters making sure that things within the same class are as similar as possible and items in numerous classes are as dissimilar as you can.","authors":[{"name":"Poonam  Khokher","ids":["115077984"]},{"name":"Kiran  Jain","ids":["2055618083"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["17aab36d18833d6b4b65c1b75a46d7683af6e993","b17a919a33b0e7e46de5578a767de2db5c7cab9e","05de6dd4eea392e22616d1bff9ff8bb84071286e","e2554c8ee7a3678feb9a8317ff8cf03e84e3ed36","e341cb48967d8bfd8cfcb6543878ccf78ee5fafa","371e004bc739b68de238b66f0c8045767e7260d9","0ce85b49c97efb151ee36013b6cf74841d57e53b","98bbb0be416e575fb6c740e7bbf7a9b0752aadc7","62b264e051a7981e156373e102c3f2c20c9e053a","515c333a48d28accdde9ecb79c30117a26faf5a1"],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f094fe5997d32ff827eb384c94ff76de664bc502","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology","journalVolume":"2","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2598975810","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"341f7c45fb6633bfe413d4045b358cffe73af90e","title":"Mixture Model Segmentation System for Parasagittal Meningioma brain Tumor Classification based on Hybrid Feature Vector","paperAbstract":"Meningioma is the one of the most common type of brain tumor, it as arises from the meninges and encloses the spine and the brain inside the skull. It accounts for 30% of all types of brain tumor. Meningioma’s can occur in many parts of the brain and accordingly it is named. In this paper, a mixture model based classification of meningioma brain tumor using MRI image is developed. The proposed method consists of four stages. In the first stage, with respect to the cells’ boundary, it is necessary to further processing, which ensures the boundary of some cells is a discrete region. Mathematical Morphology brings a fancy result during the discrete processing. Accurate cancer cell nucleus segmentation is necessary for automated cytological image analysis. Thresholding is a crucial step in segmentation..An adaptive binarization technique is an important step for medical image analysis.Finally, a novel hybrid Fuzzy SVM is designed in the classification stage meningioma brain tumor.

According to WHO standard, the 700,000 humans are being with a brain tumor and around 86,000 are diagnosed since 2019. While the total number of deaths due to brain tumors is 16,830 since 2019 and the average survival rate is 35%. Therefore, automated techniques are needed to grade brain tumors precisely from MRI scans. In this work, a new deep learning‐based method is proposed for microscopic brain tumor detection and tumor type classification. A 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is designed at the first step to extract brain tumor and extracted tumors are passed to a pretrained CNN model for feature extraction. The extracted features are transferred to the correlation‐based selection method and as the output, the best features are selected. These selected features are validated through feed‐forward neural network for final classification. Three BraTS datasets 2015, 2017, and 2018 are utilized for experiments, validation, and accomplished an accuracy of 98.32, 96.97, and 92.67%, respectively.

Early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumor is important for the treatment process. It is an important step for specialists to detect the brain tumor using computer aided systems. These systems allow specialists to perform tumor detection more easily. However, mistakes made with traditional methods are also prevented. In this paper, it is aimed to diagnose the brain tumor using MRI images. CNN models, one of the deep learning networks, are used for the diagnosis process. Resnet50 architecture, one of the CNN models, is used as the base. The last 5 layers of the Resnet50 model have been removed and added 8 new layers. With this model, 97.2% accuracy value is obtained. Also, results are obtained with Alexnet, Resnet50, Densenet201, InceptionV3 and Googlenet models. Of all these models, the model developed with the highest performance has classified the brain tumor images. As a result, when analyzed in other studies in the literature, it is concluded that the developed method is effective and can be used in computer-aided systems to detect brain tumor.","authors":[{"name":"Ahmet  Çinar","ids":["3270256"]},{"name":"Muhammed  Yildirim","ids":["40132164"]}],"inCitations":["453994a41e23f6fa6e149efce8a4401f0c408f4b","c839f6c923055bd1988747ef284071293c9ad6d2","2de6d39acd685078d67d8724109e0710d6ca33ad","7a5509b2b8dd43629601d28aac0a31d02b091f22","d0efd261e12c316a0a4f50c2f673af04a04b6200","28e0594eff702861acb59d0418fe9c18f48baa6a","b58f734c605d0ea3060420c93cfa35ec26b437b9","6dbd4d847c9fc1c52a9034f44bfd8db8b8ce3559","6cb17a9debc36855ea2213852534aa8e42ab9627","1cffeb0817828362916ab52b1ac064ccc7e1fcc8","f9e59f9c388e1d3e023965915a9bb28ef264505a","4d8f0ae904779a50b2e18fec49e51a5661a98d8a","dc598826f23aac74edc73b5893e064788b79cf43","0c863facfc147d23707e8b3eecd389a2cf819c68","a868439c89bd55708ee5694695146b0591909a69","ce17da4577e5b2a5a3ff6fda0ee0685e5ef01f0b","0f3b9c31ed87bc62267855101e09030251f37c00","5e663dd652209626ae31d3464bb050c6a03a19b1","a07c2da4ee1827719f2c4202cbe81a3f63dc010c","c3c26d9b88b6005ac19b79c0180b31b4aaec60c2","1a53187ab0cb7de78a5857a7b2e925e3d4faa39a","6414ea60b00b5f547d2d2a8fb0d2121688bc0baf","e9f624ffdfb69e6de00cf9605bef99ca1be728fe","963d73e7d46725d462dfa5060ecf9e44fc005f97","d9daed2905a47303e1a791051941f319ed9a401e","3404d2c5d16b884ba8e5a5a1c690b32077b1d757","33127246fe597d37ab1df096319a6c529ca08766","c7f1176177b1df8e234d630b45494838e01dbf9f","35b37e3f477ee00d7e782d158ef825255b40a614"],"outCitations":["cc121749121f77c08256dc0dc5ec3075593f3d97","9c800e6788e5b112b347110a7549a2e2481469dc","5bdfd78fb2285b9306e93bd3a4b534d19bf55f06","635d0584d1799d9ab3c856396d8c3d9b83ec7004","e3332906e0441852d683fbc3d3dfa9e4d7f0d8b1","a002e71561c90767240672f357b7d9e6d4d95186","ae7fe30c9c41cc59b79827666702e6442a6ae50c","d21dca8d36ef08e62ae76f0140ec2f304a33e425","b488301938f984391fd6ca0a917bbbbf0fbc8ec6","4765b043e7488f9bfbe3d3f8940bb0252bc9fd47","fc37722bb49bfb716f4baf546891d78077e8bfca","b68d3514aad012e24cb076e4cdea7dce74c97413","9978d47cfd83fb97a20fad61864bfab84ab2eda8","341f7c45fb6633bfe413d4045b358cffe73af90e"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a1f85d85a9a32bab9a8793421fa2bf7e3502924c","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Medical hypotheses","journalName":"Medical hypotheses","journalVolume":"139","journalPages":"\n          109684\n        ","doi":"10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109684","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109684","pmid":"32240877","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"3014047622","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"3135206311af9bf638f4cb6cc7902cb25ee0a04a","title":"High performance visualization of human tumor detection using WTMM on Parallel Computing System","paperAbstract":"In the effort to reduce the number of cancer survivor, various technique have been conducted.

Detection of the brain tumor in its early stage is the key to its cure. Early diagnosis of the brain tumor is very important. With the development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Soft Computing Techniques, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) attracts more and more attention for brain tumor diagnosis. Accuracy and efficiency are two major issues in designing CAD systems. In the brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the tumor may appear clearly but for further treatment, the physician also needs the quantification of the tumor area. The computer and image processing techniques can provide great help in analyzing the tumor area. In this paper features based on shape and texture of image were tested for analysis and classification of brain tumors. After feature extraction, linear vector quantization is used to classify brain tumor in to malignant & benign types. MATLAB ® 7.01 image processing toolbox and ANN toolbox have been used to implement the algorithm.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used for brain tumor diagnosis; however, it is a challenging problem to achieve higher accuracy and performance, which is a vital problem in most of the previously presented automated medical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Two-Track U-Net(HTTU-Net) architecture for brain tumor segmentation. This architecture leverages the use of Leaky Relu activation and batch normalization. It includes two tracks; each one has a different number of layers and utilizes a different kernel size. Then, we merge these two tracks to generate the final segmentation. We use the focal loss, and generalized Dice (GDL), loss functions to address the problem of class imbalance. The proposed segmentation method was evaluated on the BraTS’2018 datasets and obtained a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.865 for the whole tumor region, 0.808 for the core region and 0.745 for the enhancement region and a median Dice similarity coefficient of 0.883, 0.895, and 0.815 for the whole tumor, core and enhancing region, respectively. The proposed HTTU-Net architecture is sufficient for the segmentation of brain tumors and achieves highly accurate results. Other quantitative and qualitative evaluations are discussed, along with the paper. It confirms that our results are very comparable expert human-level performance and could help experts to decrease the time of diagnostic.","authors":[{"name":"Nagwa M.

However, dose optimisation each treatment session puts the patient at risk of successive X-Ray exposure from Computed Tomography CT scans since this imaging modality is the reference for dose planning. Add to this difficulties related to contour propagation. Thus, approaches are focusing on the use of MRI as the only modality in RT. In this paper, we review methods for creating pseudo-CT images from MRI data for MRI-alone RT. Each class of methods is explained and underlying works are presented in detail with performance results. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each class. \nMethods: We classified recent works in deriving a pseudo-CT from MR images into four classes: segmentation-based, intensity-based, atlas-based and hybrid methods and the classification was based on considering the general technique applied. \nResults: Most research focused on the brain and the pelvic regions. The mean absolute error ranged from 80 to 137 HU and from 36.4 to 74 HU for the brain and pelvis, respectively. In addition, an interest in the Dixon MR sequence is increasing since it has the advantage of producing multiple contrast images with a single acquisition. \nConclusion: Radiation therapy is emerging towards the generalisation of MRI-only RT thanks to the advances in techniques for generation of pseudo-CT images and the development of specialised MR sequences favouring bone visualisation. However, a benchmark needs to be established to set in common performance metrics to assess the quality of the generated pseudo-CT and judge on the efficiency of a certain

imaging","paperAbstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that is used to obtain images of soft tissue throughout the body. Since its development in the 1970s, MRI has gained tremendous importance in clinical practice because it can produce high quality images of diagnostic value in an ever expanding range of applications from neuroimaging to body imaging to cancer. By far the dominant signal source in MRI is hydrogen nuclei in water. The presence of water at high concentration (-50M) in body tissue, combined with signal contrast modulation induced by the local environment of water molecules, accounts for the success of MRI as a medical imaging modality. As opposed to conventional MRI, which derives its signal from the water component, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) acquires the magnetic resonance signal from other chemical components, most frequently various metabolites in the brain, but also signals from tumors in breast and prostate. The spectroscopic signal arises from low concentration (-1 10mM) compounds, but in spite of the challenges posed by the resulting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the development of MRS is motivated by the desire to directly observe signal sources other than water. The combination of MRS with spatial encoding is called magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). MRSI captures not only the relative intensities of metabolite signals at each voxel, but also their spatial distributions.","authors":[{"name":"Itthi  Chatnuntawech","ids":["1862267"]}],"inCitations":["e3af6adc4615c9835eb237148370857547af7f43","a58edd0412a65bdb9e9e74538b018dd20e06a3e5"],"outCitations":["71ce580662b034cdcdb12f946b27184dfb97fa80","f3d820ebc9653746bcdc87bf9da51cc004904917","7043a512efa09872dde6bc9afa3293db3271998f","e585e7d904a0db50423f9ae9975524b5208fc32e","54444846cf6d44f82b09ecf2b322adf63b4aee83","c807e5be22246578ec3169eddcd9feee7e2b915b","7cf41c7553690fc188cdbb45ad6265e542710659","7fd2449c74d4d04ed67dcdc754ec4b345da2a8c8","1a08ad6fdebab6d7b4f1358673ad07dfa6ab6401","798c6024402fa8f573b8e598fea1c47db299bef2","e2c47c9191af2035d3853753c6c3e7bf596e9cbb","a85cbcb9a8989fc9a73fb58b86a878ee236e332f","42d0484118739c5e94d0fe6679b3651c2dab7b4f","4b0ec2aa3160bd54950336a8d73a9b10d2541db0","4891d5c990cbe73ba123f208b83b505b258e0ec3","8193d038b1c13401882a34d46e6b434881e4f9dc","b1340cc9369e92a67e9825a74e6eb9a7e8badf6d","1f4ba793e179714e7887a82d3b41e3174989c9ee","fcb41bcf9ceceb5651fc5ae915e14f3100fd6700","af1994a77054208c85eeb2befef571520f1a3849","99cc8937a1575833445e7310eb87415657598b7a","58f9aaeecc68e84c474f5c4b18d198c269d26567","e70c4e0278c4b6d902fd380b45df4e159ccf2723","9398d46bfd3dd1f46a38f92955a16c530ca72e48","d45fadfe804d204f4b466880509fe2322c95abea","e2a04a0943533c75abe531835889d49803e0063f","70a4886a10609dfdeebb577f68d71e0d54e7a424","cf325ae27110e5ddf91e6cb13c402d1a23c714b8","75a3a9cd5190dfc6e348344bb3447a26cca73d31","6fe0a79a65a7412d7024d00f79ac021903d35813","9e1aa5ee031daa3d6b8bff21e7a9ec3300df02f8","b184390da5b836142caab88040b85070308f38a0","b5e3d22c021eebaa060c8c2d851a449d1d3916ee","ec6271dd0df8e9d22aaa96a0f6ec7482836786f2","9ea1388c4c1faaab9baafc4341d01428df801c1b","7d5aedecdfc4e8f83638bac47eb7cf2f860ec51c","ddf024609021a0aee0c10ae6541c19ceccd17623","08e9489e68834609d6c650d3c9e00a4779154073","ae6726f9aa2ae1421b0145828660efc38c15614c","7aa6037c80c2beaab8f6076c1562b9c405ababe3","42c4c501fee1e908efa208aec3a7b098f6b0c082","97e00769f543947218ee3b455dae4ee3223de848","c3c3fadd80e33a033d428157bca889969aedf1c4"],"year":2013,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/755a3eab4c7167bb015cd726c27314079370dfc1","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/82376/862074792-MIT.pdf?sequence=2"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"1586147802","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"d056ee5e34590707d8a503c0d8211612c86a7539","title":"Skewness and Kurtosis of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient in Human Brain Lesions to Distinguish Benign and Malignant Using MRI","paperAbstract":"The application of Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) in cancer identification and discrimination is increase singly interest within last decade. DWI has significant advantages, as it does not require contrast medium and provides qualitative and quantitative information that can be helpful for lesion assessment. Therefore, this study presents the utility of skewness and kurtosis of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) to distinguish between benign and malignant brain lesions. All the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were performed with a 3 Tesla Siemens Skyra MR system using a head coil. The sample consists of six subjects with locally advanced brain lesion. The Echo-Planar Imaging pulse sequence was used to acquire axial DW MRI data with a flip angle = \\(90^{\\circ }\\), Time of Echo/Time of Repetition (TE/TR) = 98/6400 ms, Field of View (FOV) = 256 mm, matrix size = 256 \\(\\times \\) 256, slice thickness of 1 mm and two levels of diffusion sensitization (\\({\\text {b} = 0 \\text { and } 1000\\,\\text {s}/\\text {mm}^2}\\)). MATLAB 2014 Simulink software was used for the data analysis. The Region of Interest (ROI) the brain lesion was selected. The mean values of both the skewness and kurtosis of ADC within the ROI were determined and finally, the values were compared between benign and malignant brain lesions. The mean kurtosis and skewness of malignant and benign are 3.201, 3.738 and 0.071, 0.463 respectively. The mean kurtosis of benign is significantly high whereas mean skewness is significantly low. Therefore, there is a possibility of utilizing mean skewness and kurtosis pixel values as a potential biomarker to differentiate between benign and malignant brain lesions. ...","authors":[{"name":"Sahan M.

This task is still manually performed, which is time-consuming and prone to observer variability. To address these issues, and as alternative to atlas-based segmentation methods, machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines (SVM), have been recently presented to segment subcortical structures on magnetic resonance images (MRI).MethodsSVM is proposed to segment the brainstem on MRI in multicenter brain cancer context. A dataset composed by 14 adult brain MRI scans is used to evaluate its performance. In addition to spatial and probabilistic information, five different image intensity values (IIVs) configurations are evaluated as features to train the SVM classifier. Segmentation accuracy is evaluated by computing the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), absolute volumes difference (AVD) and percentage volume difference between automatic and manual contours.ResultsMean DSC for all proposed IIVs configurations ranged from 0.89 to 0.90. Mean AVD values were below $$1.5\\,\\hbox {cm}^{3}$$1.5cm3, where the value for best performing IIVs configuration was $$0.85\\,\\hbox {cm}^{3}$$0.85cm3, representing an absolute mean difference of $$3.99\\,\\%$$3.99% with respect to the manual segmented volumes.ConclusionResults suggest consistent volume estimation and high spatial similarity with respect to expert delineations. The proposed approach outperformed presented methods to segment the brainstem, not only in volume similarity metrics, but also in segmentation time. Preliminary results showed that the approach might be promising for adoption in clinical use.","authors":[{"name":"Jose  Dolz","ids":["144702316"]},{"name":"Anne  Laprie","ids":["2213873"]},{"name":"Soléakhéna  Ken","ids":["2266789"]},{"name":"Henri-Arthur  Leroy","ids":["34735316"]},{"name":"Nicolas  Reyns","ids":["2558936"]},{"name":"Laurent  Massoptier","ids":["1871432"]},{"name":"Maximilien  Vermandel","ids":["3288951"]}],"inCitations":["e1aab7ce9e43b9cecf32a6ed9ffe859f5409304c","e870df2b08b47beead6e71403b68e6584e34cb9a","25bac47fc8834a7d5e043a8f13847c2dba5c8a32","2d28b0f5294a60872335899b0af9b0f44a421661","1aa13337453084a4e54c6c3729893caa917692de","4ff3eb9a99c7e2b491e5f91075df5c3abb0360ac","9fd62b2f8c94fcff878f20e441c4a04ea5727430","37fa40b3d852c2b01d9b61c36e02fbd95c1edf37","7b0933cb29eceb26f1985b5b00fa63b92a605aa7","ba16527234e92169c8f3735310ce8a5e78b08cb7","42b47a4b3609d8d5b7e82141c1bf343a0da77e14","1a20bb2fe1dcf91750a93ab51e4fca1c68ad1ef1","42137e0d1355b9a39b0564a9b3225d0a0ccb918e","c846c537205be727dc0eee5c87bfae8868e42003","090dc6adb27cd5e4048746f0ee2a2fd087746530","5bf3e1f06e60b711738006c63567a28390607043","0eda650032002c277d5066df85dcabd26af3e6cc","caf5f5ab07907a89ccdc1be8989d301c35bb8f93"],"outCitations":["273dfbcb68080251f5e9ff38b4413d7bd84b10a1","d364c4f3c8de84241e1ef557288eb8b3054b211a","251c6bf96f7f1d5303a21e4c279c36cecf17cfe0","23045299013e8738bc8eff73827ef8de256aef66","39df6d28f0b32adc2f76c21307adfcc6470c2f0f","a31c3ed9948e2eb2b24c6612cb027530e912b997","eb82e449285f8b23cf86fc20dcac89bb265d0339","4b2bf040321196925620dd3a72dbd08fe73938de","a2127f8c1dfe227001695ece3490cdbcbb3c1453","aada487238b207e0750ef3620a0aa0ce4b537f26","7ed0c8361c5321e350d2bc9003781a1c82602bc4","2dc551677ddaf5ce0a9f1e8b1cee8945d7a8e5b3","caa92ba336282966e543a9673fc5af8d0dd14058","2b8b079f5eeb31a555f1a48db3b93cd8c73b2b0c","a8937cfefe1700a0e44e7034cf18148bbe2c104a"],"year":2015,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d1a6e5f8a2755bc326471e365a3db0bfbb26f10a","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01181348/document","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q35710013"],"venue":"International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","journalName":"International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","journalVolume":"11","journalPages":"43-51","doi":"10.1007/s11548-015-1266-2","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-015-1266-2","pmid":"26206715","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"954948471","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a9a6b3d15c1c29d7ff83e650a0c7dc2f3b2df073","title":"Comparison of brain tumor MRI classification methods using probabilistic features","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor has remained one of the key causes of death in people of all ages. One way to increase survival rate amongst patients is to correctly diagnose cancer in its early stages. There are several classifiers which can classify cancer images with high accuracy. The goal of this paper was to present a brief survey of the main machine learning methods used in literature to classify brain tumor in MRI images. For an unbiased comparison between the different methods used in literature, gray level co-occurrence matrix probabilistic features(GLCM) were used as input features for training and testing the models. Two methodologies were used to establish the significance of feature reduction in classification accuracy. In the first methodology, the extracted feature set from GLCM was applied to the classifiers for comparison of performance. In the second methodology, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the extracted features and afterwards the uncorrelated reduced vector was applied to the same classifiers. As a result, it was observed that the reduced uncorrelated features improved the accuracy of all classifiers by 10 to 27%.","authors":[{"name":"Lubna  Farhi","ids":["81888509"]},{"name":"Adeel  Yusuf","ids":["15717265"]}],"inCitations":["8c6b2081aa21a76dbfbb77dbe13433929cc1e5c7","a95c4b3adae9bab2eecebd552ed363d559294060","153edf8ecc822968ed156ba58b5f8eef57992655","a395478878ef372f57e104397c20355f62d06e6e","30ccaf01c9f00d56ba40e7096365ed419fd74e78","96f93890dc72f65e7ca41a827918b17dc2b0d6a1","95f36331d77711d66ec226fbafafbfc142ae1087","2732e438e0dcaced08059436e831c95af2bce29a"],"outCitations":["dce5383440cb7931335133c44ab7cd6e874eb649","bed12439831b7a7294149b3ab15a05075dc83920","a445924b43c08b2094d1e772689c6447a48b99be","276543b44716f4d2d8bafd87f4943fe994ca7e4e","4c06e53bda3b83bcf071f8446bd12495be22ed2b","b7449194b22fb27f90f7587c966fb30cf3f6e796","6414f4543f7062640f39f5c267a014e7308cd870","af00ef45f0d207bf1f7403e8818761aa88fc83bb","c73a2c8c57b360323e5582db92854576ea6fbeed","3b72ac2f79167254697f1d71bf51a8bfbea89e46","5bf16b1e1b5c5c55c7d491ecec29af3f79b46623","6ad785d55427b210bcf71cd85022f16a0324d859","62e76aa7b45589d945b6b40e91d765a79fa9b832","1fdb62555eb650662dbe2a6f3985d390861597c2","80bc248c4a5a8bdfbfd4382de6264d426608988e","846b97f0dff3be0235cbc698cd861fa5281d6806","70d99665161abfa3db77cce7fb440401f0be1605","370caefa0e0cba9c1bd47816ec2baac03cbb288f","90c3fb9515d6bdbf45e76fb60227abaa5b571f98","dd037853109aaf44efc86b7bad175b214891718f","9509c435260fce9dbceaf44b52791ac8fc5343bf"],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a9a6b3d15c1c29d7ff83e650a0c7dc2f3b2df073","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.actapress.com/PDFViewer.aspx?paperId=456415"],"venue":"2017 13th IASTED International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (BioMed)","journalName":"2017 13th IASTED International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (BioMed)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"55-62","doi":"10.2316/P.2017.852-059","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2316/P.2017.852-059","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2593116758","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"4a6503fe3adf6ad03614810cb83835cdea2089ba","title":"A Deep Learning Algorithm for Fully Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation","paperAbstract":"Tumor segmentation is of great importance for diagnosis and prognosis of brain cancer in medical field. Many of the existing brain tumor segmentation methods are semiautomatic which need interventions of raters or specialists. In this paper an automatic method, named wide residual & pyramid pool network (WRN-PPNet), which can automatically segment glioma end to end is put forward. The main idea is described below. Firstly, substantial two-dimensional (2D) slices are obtained from three-dimensional (3D) MRI brain tumor images. Secondly, the 2D slices are normalized and put into the WRN-PPNet model, and the model will output the tumor segmentation results. Finally, dice coefficient (Dice), sensitivity coefficient (Sensitivity) and predictive positivity value (PPV) coefficient are used to evaluate the performance of WRN-PPNet quantitatively. The experimental results show that the proposed method is simple and robust compared with the other state-of- the-art methods, and the average Dice, Sensitivity and PPV on the randomly selected test data can reach 0.94, 0.92 and 0.97 respectively.","authors":[{"name":"Yu  Wang","ids":[]},{"name":"Changsheng  Li","ids":["46651332"]},{"name":"Ting  Zhu","ids":["2072834222"]},{"name":"Chongchong  Yu","ids":["9198597"]}],"inCitations":["4c8d76f1a7cbc85a730edaa1a23fd1c213f60655","abfb457caba5314466652825260c12da01a41e0f"],"outCitations":["2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","3a35746fa5e848c785ad9b9d986d58f5a951bf5e","ba6961160c10bab1b37b89dbee65d91133ba4acf","776d9e705c8d27c3a71219e72128e8285119a39e","c01f6960618c9b357832d6d654c6bc2af4c90b84","0824550ffc8417d291f74c36a84b9082e91721aa","1031a69923b80ad01cf3fbb703d10757a80e699b","8755a46d48a1054ce9fecaf155f5c0066f5e20c1","0cc4baae4f621e64826534c575d3870d6f49d37d","e0067a9c3f30aab46d9e6f8844dc36e83c85869f","4f439629a92d69050469afd2e4f9b16332174df2","6c82db7816a95306d7dcdb418257baf53410ba89","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","2173f1b8172c9b5bed4650c81b69988717bd6df6","5f47c204ff83dafbef794e62611e217018b9e45f","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","1c4e9156ca07705531e45960b7a919dc473abb51","6dc07d95e339123bdd0d1b2cf0582ec9834317fc"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4a6503fe3adf6ad03614810cb83835cdea2089ba","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852210"],"venue":"2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","journalName":"2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-5","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852210","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852210","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2977419649","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"b43d7ef593f69d8567be464d0b70c3b28ae51144","title":"Characterization of Murine Glioma by Magnetic Resonance Elastography: Preliminary Results","paperAbstract":"Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a non-invasive imaging technique that permits quantitative measurement of the mechanical properties of biological tissue. In MRE, coherent tissue displacements are induced by a mechanical actuator and images are collected in synchrony with these mechanical motions. Components of displacement in any direction can be measured by applying the motion-encoding gradients along that direction. The mechanical properties of tissue are derived by fitting measured displacement data to the equations governing wave propagation. A number of groups have explored the diagnostic value of MRE in the clinical setting, driven largely by the empirically observed relationship between tissue health and stiffness. The investigation of MRI methods as biomarkers of tumor progression and early therapeutic response remains an extremely active and important area of research. In this regard, MRE has considerable potential for staging cancer and monitoring the effects of therapy. We seek to demonstrate the utility of MRE for cancer staging by tracking the viscoelastic properties of brain tumor in a mouse model of high-grade glioma. Brain tissue viscoelasticity cannot be probed in vivo by any other known imaging technique, yet is suspected to contain valuable information about tissue health. Preliminary results indicate elastographic sensitivity to the presence of brain tumors in the living mouse.","authors":[{"name":"E. H. Clayton","ids":["50379146"]},{"name":"John A.

We propose a novel automated brain tumor segmentation method based on a probabilistic model combining sparse coding and Markov random field (MRF). We formulate the brain tumor segmentation task as a pixel-wise labeling problem with regard to three classes: tumor, edema and healthy issue. For each class, dictionary learning is performed independently on multi-modality gray scale patches. Sparse representation is then extracted based on a joint dictionary which is constructed by combing the three independent dictionaries. Finally, we build the probabilistic model aiming to estimate maximum a posterior (MAP) probability by introducing the sparse representation into likelihood probability and prior probability using the Markov random field (MRF) assumption. Compared with traditional methods, which employed hand-crafted low level features to construct the probabilistic model, our model can better represent the characteristics of a pixel and its relation with neighbors based on the sparse coefficients obtained from the learned dictionary. We validated our method on the MICAAI 2012 BRATS challenge brain MRI dataset and achieved comparable or better results compared with state-of the-art methods.","authors":[{"name":"Yuhong  Li","ids":["2110539125"]},{"name":"Qi  Dou","ids":["35647880"]},{"name":"Jinze  Yu","ids":["2188112"]},{"name":"Fucang  Jia","ids":["1916938"]},{"name":"Jing  Qin","ids":["2114048688"]},{"name":"Pheng-Ann  Heng","ids":["1714602"]}],"inCitations":["cbda457f7a26c404b074bd13eb746cf9aaee1cf4","0dc908aff5cd5ca5b7beb150ab8cb8b5f825b1cc","e870df2b08b47beead6e71403b68e6584e34cb9a","ff4719699749e25b013605af3ca3f3be24d3f242","c8ecc5d8d92ebda0aea892d5cfc65c76f7583be1","514aad618a339ce7a0d259546bd6d7451397f51d","efb06ca205b92e92e4cfb508724a1f4622fad28c","fd570c162f46e29a3aa3dba4181d3414db346049","188eeda6c4beb6836d9e335f4f79a072b06bb9ef","21fe83935193a306b02f5c8eb6bfe51cbb547be9"],"outCitations":["f83cba993ed023e25b38ecd65906d68c55ca6db8","cf80cc34528273d8fbe17783efe802a6509e1562","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","307c0b7c163cc50d20483c18034be62b5ee22004","7cb4596ffb6aa403f0bd67f5f8f40ef88b7c876f","4e607b44337fe7160cb4f4ce153332c7e53964a7","7550de14ab0e4a7c16e950a17f64e6da88544ba1","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","80b2dba230f924a319889cd9cf9411687efc45f7","3120324069ec20eed853d3f9bbbceb32e4173b93","d311f830fabc57bc66c371b099196d7391b921fe"],"year":2015,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/19da574f7ae2343970b5b253a27a5700ac7cef79","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~qdou/papers/2015/%5B2015%5D%5BPRNI%5DAutomatic%20brain%20tumor%20segmentation%20from%20MR%20images%20via%20a%20multimodal%20sparse%20coding%20based%20probabilistic%20model.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/PRNI.2015.18"],"venue":"2015 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging","journalName":"2015 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"41-44","doi":"10.1109/PRNI.2015.18","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRNI.2015.18","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"1550071438","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"d4127e481d56055649250b47b1039aceaada3751","title":"Analysis of filtering and novel technique for noise removal in MRI and CT images","paperAbstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging is a technique to get a clear picture of group of cells (tissue) and group of tissue (organ) by using magnetic and radio waves, and which is without x-ray and other harmful radiation. which leads to cancer, and it placed a major role in treating brain, ankle, foot and prostate cancer.

Many methods of brain tumor segmentation are available in the literature but none of the method achieved satisfactory performance. Brain tumor has caused more deaths compared to other cases related to cancer. Due to the complex structure of the brain tumor and its merging with the normal tissues, the classification of tumor from normal tissues is a challenging task. In this article, we have proposed LIPC based methodology for brain tumor classification and segmentation. The main idea is to take the segmentation challenge as a multiclass classification task. MRI sequences of the brain have common characteristics (locality) and are sparse (sparsity). We have utilized both these properties in our proposed methodology. Firstly the image preprocessing techniques are used for noise removal and image enhancement. After that different textural features were calculated and reduced by PCA for better classification score. The dataset used is that of MICCAI 2013 containing High-grade tumor and Low-grade tumor for real patient data. Our method presented a Dice Score of 0.95 for complete tumor which is by far compared to the methods already available in terms of Dice Score and time complexity.","authors":[{"name":"Khizar  Abbas","ids":["1471742438"]},{"name":"Prince Waqas Khan","ids":["92683987"]},{"name":"Khan Talha Ahmed","ids":["1471733513"]},{"name":"Wang-Cheoul  Song","ids":["1471640251"]}],"inCitations":["d6c4677078b338d318c575a52f1e9782988bfe60","7646cdbb429ff5e733d84ed1b9059e4a8e116d91","f44ff246a7ea4f743722f933839e2c56ffd95086"],"outCitations":["97335187f39a2da2a1b7bca47644fefefb1a88bf","fc491f29464210fbe9dd0ad1e2ad0989a9efe475","f44eccc26759e11a0e9851c42fca47ac55b03881","18be0fc5c3fc58c26660dbb5e26d1d600072f939","6726710f475904265d6630fad22deb20a87a15a1","68bafe3aa4bc068d5c4bfd22bfbc72c7a3ad36d6","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","42087bc6f87b3074643522cb7aff872611b2bfa1","706c09cf3f293361a261869c717f7a519e1eb32c","ba6961160c10bab1b37b89dbee65d91133ba4acf","c01f6960618c9b357832d6d654c6bc2af4c90b84","51256786adc028ced3bb1a727c1980f19ccdef98","d18f7490693c9993e67724c7c3aac7e6b3668f77","a423dc50e0ff85053bfbf1d12f1fd982cb35df40","82a9f6ab6b33f814c036e675e3d3b38e60e58b16","044bfd29b362700b00d985aa2181e80b4e3bcbec","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","f8697512702784eae2d8f1b7e29c6b2632e2b2fa","fe6b097e4639e83775030010dafd3a62e0b3ea31","73a50f51a65826e573fa966cb9a1e3126023f2f1"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a581fd38d0e783ba3c880f5094aba9f592b5cbb9","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC46691.2019.8939748"],"venue":"2019 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","journalName":"2019 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"531-536","doi":"10.1109/ictc46691.2019.8939748","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ictc46691.2019.8939748","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2997680473","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"5ae249acfd32116ccd3e60dfde4fa7016498efdb","title":"Glioblastomas brain tumour segmentation based on convolutional neural networks","paperAbstract":"Brain tumour segmentation can improve diagnostics efficiency, rise the prediction rate and treatment planning. This will help the doctors and experts in their work. Where many types of brain tumour may be classified easily, the gliomas tumour is challenging to be segmented because of the diffusion between the tumour and the surrounding edema. Another important challenge with this type of brain tumour is that the tumour may grow anywhere in the brain with different shape and size. Brain cancer presents one of the most famous diseases over the world, which encourage the researchers to find a high-throughput system for tumour detection and classification. Several approaches have been proposed to design automatic detection and classification systems. This paper presents an integrated framework to segment the gliomas brain tumour automatically using pixel clustering for the MRI images foreground and background and classify its type based on deep learning mechanism, which is the convolutional neural network. In this work, a novel segmentation and classification system is proposed to detect the tumour cells and classify the brain image if it is healthy or not. After collecting data for healthy and non-healthy brain images, satisfactory results are found and registered using computer vision approaches. This approach can be used as a part of a bigger diagnosis system for breast tumour detection and manipulation.","authors":[{"name":"Moh'd Rasoul Al-Hadidi","ids":["1403853729"]},{"name":"Bayan  Al-Saaidah","ids":["70736037"]},{"name":"Mohammed Yousef Al-Gawagzeh","ids":["1403892768"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["d1ac4807aaf291969ed397ac6e4a7299138a250a","f46dcc882971cc080b787dc338f25f8aa65b24b6","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","35d618374e3bb542b3301ba6a7ec576ba65ff9c9","d33c9745c29e830b515e2579dd59472401942e74","68bafe3aa4bc068d5c4bfd22bfbc72c7a3ad36d6","8b7f7348d8eb1cff41a62aae6384d032c6442f06","ba9690ece452e167a3cb1525f004227a0136120f","06b1e091807533dc366fb64bcf16727ff95cc43b","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","9f362ee116f1ad798f2487ac5ea42174fc488f95","b8de958fead0d8a9619b55c7299df3257c624a96","e90c52fc4099e2ad448563c1d368c97d78e0f086","b3c785b99ec147049caa47f707f337b717705970","251c39c1b9372f3055cd53d0001fc122bfb2e418","f8697512702784eae2d8f1b7e29c6b2632e2b2fa","f3b2e952dd77cab93cdfc6df844f83bc0db38bde","6089d5fd5934978d95fb540f9f5b807ed50bd4af","02e70a69005abf21219271f460161ea4d1650dd9","26ea625713a15fb3a279dc529d89f56f73182a71","774c311db20a940a7024df578febbad5de720909","a5075a9a0d30ea5e5ef1816f25b64a109436a966","9b609d135d68b814bbed0b5dad12e8f8955fdcd8","60636b68e8b38c3248db4bd59ee31a37aab781e4"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5ae249acfd32116ccd3e60dfde4fa7016498efdb","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE/article/download/21202/14184"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","journalVolume":"10","journalPages":"4738-4744","doi":"10.11591/IJECE.V10I5.PP4738-4744","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11591/IJECE.V10I5.PP4738-4744","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3022394316","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"0b2ee24e8ac73446496a67a0976102e03faec996","title":"Visualization in biomedical computing : 4th International Conference, VBC '96, Hamburg, Germany, September 22-25, 1996 : proceedings","paperAbstract":"GI tract unraveling in volumetric CT.- Segmentation of the visible human for high quality volume based visualization.- Illustrating anatomic models - A semi-interactive approach.- A fast rendering method using the tree structure of objects in virtualized bronchus endoscope system.- An optimal ray traversal scheme for visualizing colossal medical volumes.- A direct multi-volume rendering method.

Mammography has been the most reliable and accurate technique for early and accurate detection of breast cancer. This paper presents machine learning based mammogram classification techniques. The authors propose an improved hybrid KNN-SVM classifier to improve the performance of the expert system. It is based on mapping feature points to kernel space and finds the K nearest neighbours for a given test data point among the training dataset. This narrow down search for support vectors to the more relevant data points. The proposed algorithm is tested on standard MIAS and DDSM mammograms databases and brain MRI database. The results are compared with different machine learning classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Random Forest, C4.5, Logistic Regression, Fisher Discriminant analysis, Naive Bayesian classifiers. The results show that the performance of the proposed classifier is better compared to the other classifiers.","authors":[{"name":"Poonam  Sonar","ids":["152425447"]},{"name":"Udhav  Bhosle","ids":["2606458"]},{"name":"Chandrajit  Choudhury","ids":["32242514"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a438512262e65736d097a0718ce9892e2a595a40","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"The International Journal on the Image","journalVolume":"3","journalPages":"152","doi":"10.1504/IJIM.2018.10017591","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/IJIM.2018.10017591","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2901444229","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"6989679f0e9bc95b827ac989cda6f8b391a72172","title":"NeXt for neuro‐radiosurgery: A fully automatic approach for necrosis extraction in brain tumor MRI using an unsupervised machine learning technique","paperAbstract":"Stereotactic neuro‐radiosurgery is a well‐established therapy for intracranial diseases, especially brain metastases and highly invasive cancers that are difficult to treat with conventional surgery or radiotherapy. Nowadays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most used modality in radiation therapy for soft‐tissue anatomical districts, allowing for an accurate gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation. Investigating also necrotic material within the whole tumor has significant clinical value in treatment planning and cancer progression assessment. These pathological necrotic regions are generally characterized by hypoxia, which is implicated in several aspects of tumor development and growth. Therefore, particular attention must be deserved to these hypoxic areas that could lead to recurrent cancers and resistance to therapeutic damage. This article proposes a novel fully automatic method for necrosis extraction (NeXt), using the Fuzzy C‐Means algorithm, after the GTV segmentation. This unsupervised Machine Learning technique detects and delineates the necrotic regions also in heterogeneous cancers. The overall processing pipeline is an integrated two‐stage segmentation approach useful to support neuro‐radiosurgery. NeXt can be exploited for dose escalation, allowing for a more selective strategy to increase radiation dose in hypoxic radioresistant areas. Moreover, NeXt analyzes contrast‐enhanced T1‐weighted MR images alone and does not require multispectral MRI data, representing a clinically feasible solution. This study considers an MRI dataset composed of 32 brain metastatic cancers, wherein 20 tumors present necroses. The segmentation accuracy of NeXt was evaluated using both spatial overlap‐based and distance‐based metrics, achieving these average values: Dice similarity coefficient 95.93% ± 4.23% and mean absolute distance 0.225 ± 0.229 (pixels).","authors":[{"name":"Leonardo  Rundo","ids":["2142430"]},{"name":"Carmelo  Militello","ids":["48480903"]},{"name":"Andrea  Tangherloni","ids":["5359907"]},{"name":"Giorgio  Russo","ids":["11801405"]},{"name":"Salvatore  Vitabile","ids":["1801538"]},{"name":"Maria Carla Gilardi","ids":["145407843"]},{"name":"Giancarlo  Mauri","ids":["1747770"]}],"inCitations":["0799c67f0f4aabf2ab1828e5c72053d4a7e6bc2a","cc69bdb645d1e763903cb4893e0d4857a623704b","f645d0057413f01d0b8f4788e6821970fba0e4ed","50a483975abba83f66b4d621f70f2d2128b93137","164460a8435820e8139525e8bb6db13f2d799753","34a1157e61e769fb3defe38c860419b52b2c165e","948fefd5291bba13b1417feabb0a64fb409349d9","7cc27d0cb907c537565bd274c889beb68c10bd08","d2251c797478a01e2ae32da44b015e0ca52a550f","0ca4ad71483746c299d48df31b5d19cc15f240b0","d02d9ca504ab580efd509db60f3b2291647eb947","67f45335d3023e5bcb808cebf2e832266efdc3bc","7ba7121abdfee8442c3486e003a964e57562634c","296b3bdc9d03597b47ef48ae9bd107cb793b0615"],"outCitations":["0fe7119284482e00ca4d4ff8ac4c34a03cc95264","73a50f51a65826e573fa966cb9a1e3126023f2f1","f96a8468dbfd11f8bf43e91ef39aacd9a7e82b6d","5c7b47621c67177dd179338cc2477b9620833f52","f17ce012a161b414b1ae26a7d4fa63658aab1872","45d51129c83aef914fcc25fa29debed58ef07f0d","c6c6dd169fe087acfb5dbfb8d85a25f1a912589d","4a3e9fcfc88d53cdf0b7633fbc914f98d1e92225","28eb47f734827e62a480c9259113d461e5630713","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","e37ec6967dee6ab93b6d60f24a077a25377d6f26","62df09ea3462f4d286c9f9a23dd233196400a641","9c85c6abf6bc508cd2f0ac00a1efe3dbf9fa2889","7c1d409ebff65e47c960599cf64cb41c609232a7","621feac04cad20512716a8cf42fbb73b09ac03db","9241ea3d8cb85633d314ecb74b31567b8e73f6af","81df596d48ada1ee2abd8c24cf0e86da95e300ed","932a106c21a1db1e1876459c1521d27fd152caac","987b92ce8cda9ffc00171b67da7ec8eed895b091","271bb0f8359caf096f429ea2ae8e56fb47c5ec13","9105a8c02778847bfe0f1c1f95e5e0877c8c2730","4697b29af0d3c85049f5e338f62a28b3fec821e5","67e477926e116000b3f264e61a026e7504919535","d3d1a4cddeebfbb40265ba200a80d794ec124b19","06c8452c2616bb098a92f733e8d4ec5f382afe03","4f8d648c52edf74e41b0996128aa536e13cc7e82","3121653ca578201b868542724dd167ed0e19d297","3469a9c6c78197d46921a9829c69e8cbeaa0e3c0","12a9fd5ccaace0b274cbc201586fefe6aa856d29","7510d8a1ce82391b2a0e6642bfc830c83b6e7f81","e4179ac27a92410dbd9e83da4679d9d53a37f8b2","9999184caaa7e4ca36fbc3fe9d65028fae8f2e42","e385c0d9ddc60ac19dcfed987c5e8529fc899dcc","ff457cc8d4460edab9c8e28392ca85d41942a64e","2997a6c694cf263048779fe73169ff45a2b41bd5","2082d0a43e0f4995676bdfb82a57d8ac2b91ae76","2876d002780ab8632c4e5fecb917038e8997359c","cbb181b01941d3306d4736265f5e9625cc1575f7","21fe83935193a306b02f5c8eb6bfe51cbb547be9","95b5f94814bea27a1538796f14d90715adf4f88f","a26e4157f27d91311767f9a7e37cb8c8ca0b5deb","f26cbe40db22c9b99fe95d368c3aff94beaef488","322afdd019bf1394b2b60879b7f777bfaee18fb8","aadde30a3e0e6583afbfb012ecf1045b572a9d42","dfa362309120df474500e7bcbe49ccabbfd06cc0","73056ee235e6f1fb80b5d4f4378858b7efd95920","4e234772b283e9e274791ed25911c20e08e6c462","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","4e607b44337fe7160cb4f4ce153332c7e53964a7","67e3b4deaed2bdd262191e220256a64f131d472a","1d4816c612e38dac86f2149af667a5581686cdef","d2fccfa2cb2dc975e4ae1929b5a40e762ae1841d","151baae6666d5887460536029b0179366cff3e67","0225792854438e47dc023cc53340de62d6c35507","7c2bcf6f32b05a04cd3444c030db743e5666af88","d4c9d29cf33d341d5109d6c9ce7bafc2e3b4db2a","d208ca40c7a519c2b277dd3a173cd5b5f2355906","370ff80fcafce482337327333cb9bf26f17af8c0","967746aa9d1d273745bbc25416346fad3bca54e1","c1383701b79efb77904e411639733fa296125190","5c3d7a3706edbb391a6c2c9bd93e8649c81c93f7","7e9ddcbaee5ec8006ffddd8a1ffb8249840384f9","24a85e28954871d30ebefac06b459f8c2701e7a0","8ae9fc1e08c790f737d52c4ab6e20234aa269faa","c5b01cd9bc8ad4719b6c7a00c03bb32b609a7a1f","039eb715bdca07d38794be20b471986cbd33faf5","209e131fe5d71dbe5fa3d911cca21234a3dcc67c","010f5d427da16573544d9313239880669a1afba6","4e8d670587ffcc476035138c9c078e92074088f3"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6989679f0e9bc95b827ac989cda6f8b391a72172","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57518134"],"venue":"Int.

Numerous informative ata is generated and digitalized day by day. Through computing echnologies, the cancer statistics can be established in time and ecome more informative. Data mining is firstly used in exploring extual information. Using regular expressions and fuzzy searching f relevant keywords can approximate to automatic string matchng. Reports are hand-made which shrunk information by subjecive opinions and individual considerations. Observing cancer itelf, imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and agnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can exhibit tissue composition n a non-invasive way. The image analysis requirement strengthns the importance of computing technologies. Even volume meaurement should be a basic procedure to estimate tumor status, ounting voxels by human beings is not a practical solution. The urther feature extraction and prediction model establishment are lso accomplished via the quantification by computing and statisical analysis. Three research articles are introduced here to show he roles of data mining, volume measurement, and computerided diagnosis (CAD) systems on cancers in clinical use. Varlamis et al. [1] studied data from 1998–2004 the Cancer egistry of Crete in Greece (counties of Rethymno and Lasithi) nd analyzed by using data mining techniques. Significant variaion in cancer types between sexes and age groups (the ratio beween deaths and reported cases for young patients, less than 34 ears old, is at 0.055 when the respective ratio for patients over 5 years old is 0.366) was observed. The authors Morales et al. 2] proposed BRAIM, a CAD system to help clinicians in diagnosng and treatment monitoring of brain diseases by MRI. The use of RAIM includes early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such s Parkinson, Alzheimer or Multiple Sclerosis and for brain lesion iagnosis and monitoring as well. The third interesting study about he computer-aided diagnosis of liver tumors on computed tomogaphy images by Chang et al. [3] extracted three kinds of features rom multiphase CT images. The features include texture (the grey evel co-occurrence matrix), shape (compactness, margin, and an lliptic model), and the kinetic curve. By combining all features, hey were able to achieve the highest (82%) accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"Chung-Ming  Lo","ids":["1748714"]},{"name":"Usman  Iqbal","ids":["145853433"]},{"name":"Yu-Chuan  Li","ids":["152998805"]}],"inCitations":["b31598f9357caab5e51afd2e62496c4790683efc","a3acf39e4b9390862775db2f28097187c1272b6a"],"outCitations":["31c7b47b462c07b515a73266cba4121dd4f16084","9c377d22c968ae21d97e2d4576a944084447c39f","add4ab70c0e6ecdbc1de15754a43558f306bb163"],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ac242dd92661ce2036ad51dc995995d011e4aef8","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q45323403"],"venue":"Comput.

There are factors, however, that tend to produce variation in the brightness of a displayed image even when no image detail is present. This variation is usually random and has no particular pattern. In many cases, it reduces image quality. This random variation in image brightness is designated as noise. In this experimental work, different medical images like MRI, Cancer, X-ray, and Brain images have been considered and have been then used to calculate thestandard deviation and mean of all these images after finding Speckle noise and applyingvarious filtering techniques for removal of noise. This experimental analysis will improve the accuracy of these medical images for easy diagnosis. The results, which have been achieved, are more useful and they prove to be helpful for general medical practitioners to analyze the symptoms of the patient.

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) achieved in 39K-MR images hampered data acquisition with sufficiently-high spatial and temporal resolution in animal models so far. In order to maximize the detector sensitivity, its optimal size, geometry, and temperature was determined via Electro-Magnetic (EM) simulations and bench-top measurements. A two-turn spiral, circular, room-temperature surface resonator was then developed and applied for 39K-MRI of a healthy live rat brain. Compared to the current-state-of-the-art as reported in the literature, the improved resonator sensitivity resulted in approximately five times higher SNR with twice faster acquisition time. As of the EM-simulations cryogenic-cooling could further improve the surface resonator's sensitivity three-fold at 77 K (liquid nitrogen) and up to six-fold at 20 K (liquid helium).","authors":[{"name":"I.

It naturally provides sufficient contrast between the structural differences of normal and pathological tissues, their spatial extent and progression. However, to further extend its applications and enhance even more contrast for clinical studies, various Gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents have been developed for different organs (brain strokes, cancer, cardio-MRI, etc). These Gd-based contrast agents are paramagnetic compounds that have strong T1-effect for enhancing the contrast between tissue types. Gd-contrast can also enhance magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) for studying stenosis and for measuring perfusion, vascular susceptibility, interstitial space, etc. Another class of contrast agents makes use of ferrite iron oxide nanoparticles (including Superparamagnetic Ion Oxide (SPIO) and Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide (USPIO)). These nanoparticles have superior magnetic susceptibility effect and produce a drop in signal, namely in -weighted images, useful for the determination of lymph nodes metastases, angiogenesis and arteriosclerosis plaques.","authors":[{"name":"Thian C.

To facilitate MR-only radiation therapy planning, synthetic-CT (sCT) algorithms (for electron density correction) are required for dose calculation. Deep neural networks for sCT generation are useful due to their predictive power, but lack of uncertainty information is a concern for clinical implementation. The feasibility of using a conditional generative adversarial model (cGAN) to generate sCTs with accompanying uncertainty maps was investigated. Dropout-based variational inference was used to account for uncertainty in the trained model. The cGAN loss function was also combined with an additional term such that the network learns which regions of input data are associated with highly variable outputs. On a dataset of 105 brain cancer patients, our results demonstrate that the network generates well-calibrated uncertainty predictions and produces sCTs with equivalent accuracy as previously reported deterministic models.","authors":[{"name":"Matt  Hemsley","ids":["1629251155"]},{"name":"Brige  Chugh","ids":["1983620"]},{"name":"Mark  Ruschin","ids":["2506152"]},{"name":"Young  Lee","ids":["35279372"]},{"name":"Chia-Lin  Tseng","ids":["121772540"]},{"name":"Greg  Stanisz","ids":["1985291"]},{"name":"Angus  Lau","ids":["5179243"]}],"inCitations":["a15bc4ae1faa9c20bffafbbdee7272bd2f22d368","1e243c1855d7848540109191999cfdef77d78dea"],"outCitations":["91c3b96c8865503e40d0c03000e0a61227a298d2","7edeed95537d7a145154adc0b7f87974e3ce83f0","8cf1e87543019951e337f9b0c4dec6e3c6d745c6","cf6c0c4b1a847ff8aca0b99409fee8331cd82ac9","f9f4693cef7634badcf31d51be8085758d7cf6f2","3edde3071399bde24bc2f77d872c491cfbc25dad","54e325aee6b2d476bbbb88615ac15e251c6e8214","ea88f30081c762e73163c191f09b402a63c94da3","8acbe90d5b852dadea7810345451a99608ee54c7","d54746730d1adb957b5b809a08212168ef1c8345","5ec96ea4d0685819dfa7cbb253f7d79a014fb710","dac9f6b2db6549a7e06f8cb6420772f8ccb3f42a","06f49200dc17195a5829d50eef3c3fb1dc97b590","f35de4f9b1a7c4d3fa96a0d2ab1bf8937671f6b6","89584800bbd6858ff960cdc2162cf89a000caa7f","a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8","4bc9c5a4f7dcef2a4df68e7eeb11eeed6f4d908e","36814dfafaf5ca7871eb5b5f3838db3cc1099389","ff7bcaa4556cb13fc7bf03e477172493546172cd","36aa6c01c9683783499395953c6bc856d6101feb","108ede8fdc755e76870d3a51cbe1cbd9eb066c67","6f55f2234a002c69001df8ef9108cb86f1dfa506","a929c3ae65891d4d1388f3d9ef2ee5b38644e5c4","529e9facd4e0394c6556b43449d2057648b73ec1","7d888110cbb55a9a60fc5a3abcceec09be5451b2","ef6abdcbd0871cb356e8669b6cdb31ed8b013cc2","5a7a8abae9db4bacc59811db4ae329154056dd1a","a5a71adeef7ebb98b38a3f271ad977210b6bb5ac","b185c48ec9445fa411505049366d73fd9895049a","6b118f54830361182c172306027e3af0516a3c08","7693df47fdde6a176d64ed5c2b358fe89b64d863","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","2c455f0da2bd86a9b9ea432d1485049073d7c63d","3deba7f7af82e12282ca1e592f274d66e86cc63a","23a7138eb17bfbba8e6d64d3f0edda821150f459","14a578a332507497fe3e2c46b79e4d8e94e8dd64","3c8a456509e6c0805354bd40a35e3f2dbf8069b1","627491534c3de9e5a94e220a87b7afadcb9b9b25","7cc076c3dd293544cf9280990b0be6cd74cc74ad"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0a5455eda01e0927a485303562a895ada97623a3","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59710-8_81"],"venue":"MICCAI","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"834-844","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-59710-8_81","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59710-8_81","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3089823949","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"6408836505c85a6f4c0bfa7a2150b94939f42f0b","title":"Co-occurrence of Local Anisotropic Gradient Orientations (CoLlAGe): A new radiomics descriptor","paperAbstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new radiomic descriptor, Co-occurrence of Local Anisotropic Gradient Orientations (CoLlAGe) for capturing subtle differences between benign and pathologic phenotypes which may be visually indistinguishable on routine anatomic imaging. CoLlAGe seeks to capture and exploit local anisotropic differences in voxel-level gradient orientations to distinguish similar appearing phenotypes. CoLlAGe involves assigning every image voxel an entropy value associated with the co-occurrence matrix of gradient orientations computed around every voxel. The hypothesis behind CoLlAGe is that benign and pathologic phenotypes even though they may appear similar on anatomic imaging, will differ in their local entropy patterns, in turn reflecting subtle local differences in tissue microarchitecture. We demonstrate CoLlAGe’s utility in three clinically challenging classification problems: distinguishing (1) radiation necrosis, a benign yet confounding effect of radiation treatment, from recurrent tumors on T1-w MRI in 42 brain tumor patients, (2) different molecular sub-types of breast cancer on DCE-MRI in 65 studies and (3) non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinomas) from benign fungal infection (granulomas) on 120 non-contrast CT studies.

(Apprentissage profond pour la segmentation des tumeurs cérébrales et des organes à risque en radiothérapie)","paperAbstract":"Medical images play an important role in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Oncologists analyze images to determine the different characteristics of the cancer, to plan the therapy and to observe the evolution of the disease. The objective of this thesis is to propose efficient methods for automatic segmentation of brain tumors and organs at risk in the context of radiotherapy planning, using Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. First, we focus on segmentation of brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on MRIs manually segmented by experts. We propose a segmentation model having a large 3D receptive field while being efficient in terms of computational complexity, based on combination of 2D and 3D CNNs. We also address problems related to the joint use of several MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR). Second, we introduce a segmentation model which is trained using weakly-annotated images in addition to fully-annotated images (with voxelwise labels), which are usually available in very limited quantities due to their cost. We show that this mixed level of supervision considerably improves the segmentation accuracy when the number of fully-annotated images is limited.\\\\ Finally, we propose a methodology for an anatomy-consistent segmentation of organs at risk in the context of radiotherapy of brain tumors. The segmentations produced by our system on a set of MRIs acquired in the Centre Antoine Lacassagne (Nice, France) are evaluated by an experienced radiotherapist.","authors":[{"name":"Pawel  Mlynarski","ids":["51150028"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4042c8af65c9cc35e864fba8e7518f9234770fa4","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02358374"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Philosophy","Computer Science"],"magId":"3034695418","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"7681df2a5493531c988f425de1210919b67e6b4a","title":"Efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation With Multiscale Two-Pathway-Group Conventional Neural Networks","paperAbstract":"Manual segmentation of the brain tumors for cancer diagnosis from MRI images is a difficult, tedious, and time-consuming task. The accuracy and the robustness of brain tumor segmentation, therefore, are crucial for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and treatment outcome evaluation. Mostly, the automatic brain tumor segmentation methods use hand designed features. Similarly, traditional methods of deep learning such as convolutional neural networks require a large amount of annotated data to learn from, which is often difficult to obtain in the medical domain. Here, we describe a new model two-pathway-group CNN architecture for brain tumor segmentation, which exploits local features and global contextual features simultaneously. This model enforces equivariance in the two-pathway CNN model to reduce instabilities and overfitting parameter sharing. Finally, we embed the cascade architecture into two-pathway-group CNN in which the output of a basic CNN is treated as an additional source and concatenated at the last layer. Validation of the model on BRATS2013 and BRATS2015 data sets revealed that embedding of a group CNN into a two pathway architecture improved the overall performance over the currently published state-of-the-art while computational complexity remains attractive.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Imran Razzak","ids":["1986976"]},{"name":"Muhammad  Imran","ids":["143948775"]},{"name":"Guandong  Xu","ids":["9141499"]}],"inCitations":["629e7e66864ba42dafd0558defe3fef8a33d0d28","b8504d447d358f48bc9e6b2d32314809794889c1","7a8293c8d7c615034a60faf200c1bbfdf6f209ba","4729e04cf7be9a455834f9e66f2c6bdaf1f248bf","fe1d0f8feb0892a722c51e1ce7f8aa0581be6a27","15ebedaaf1ab5361460c8844613dd60b890467af","b75f50f68c3201c093dd4aca90a529e5b8e0dee0","0dc908aff5cd5ca5b7beb150ab8cb8b5f825b1cc","cb1a31004a7e2f873fabf9d1b03762f5fcf82e19","06dae5b19b4f4f7b3fc09904c1bcf18e921be034","a333ed7440a0d7d0ec59977e1d2c250baf19ac76","f141a98815548a8c5b2e37d853bccbb1d1807909","ac89bccb5806eeafc6122a7e27affea4fe8cb809","5ed896f2e8350c93a86f2ad5b83a1b522c1c5dde","362ad55a8423639fccebbcd341bd023d864db338","35d9972f092f089deefc77a8ae40ada9a75f7b6e","232cd7abd8631eea4d4a98590d7d2a36851eaaa2","313e0f2187138f78765c18034be930dc3312c049","6767c722be6461af0af2ec0a39504abdc8ef7d83","e8a7b2a2f361219767a1fc520ea3f793eab63544","ce24099ee20cec85ad442d947e14f221a8c59d55","1a6b7243455dff0db201f11d1cb64d3b1db4ebb4","97b3aae575c18e395c38b966fc1c5bf039cdf9cd","8684f44ada26aa962d267c51dca2f3de59ad461f","49eab0f8ea47b8eed71b5c4b88ed6878789ec77e","d12c8912ea426001d905dadefa02ac6e70198439","b503093f420d1667c82246b84b86f9d5657f8c57","7863d62073960398f4ca258bd08b5f2b7854e574","30b1a4421bfc3bc9a4a2529998f9804a8195a7ef","ae399f43b8805bf70aeb63cc678a596318c81e4a"],"outCitations":["c62bf15759f48bab3bcfb6412dcd2858034f9fbe","84b3ccf6f01145da6aedeab16b40f01004de2536","bf3a357a47b14247f3bc8ef268b1d770069752c9","6ecc91743aea2d9f747c670065c3eff0b1b0e689","d952e3ef252564f5697937707dcabb3c46a44edc","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","84032c19bad3493957d1319babd19bde2821fee3","52a71208327a843e42047f63a7fa4e39fcfd68a5","976050a0d225313224bd74f1608d20c5ac35577f","1e0d030a49ecad15f67f1db1819782a69b957c99","5c077b3ad4de4f2ea99561908aa9be1520f18a14","5a0da0bccbb8840f5f8213a5817a2d77190c3be1","cab372bc3824780cce20d9dd1c22d4df39ed081a","7c2bcf6f32b05a04cd3444c030db743e5666af88","11aada215e6f72cbd5928619de839ba35106a88f","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","459cdfa379bffc07dd963610132f22421b9a0659","e5fd5e4b0a739041638e6d88b1e78e7633e8f2a6","b2e8f988e4c4ef0b38f6c8766aca7f2e5a2575db","1366991fca32ed0f957f929cd893bd3e024bc611","89d4eaf0b38523322c891ed159229ae89f2aaaef","542c57d7fd240c7c0a7f891b9dbb7a63d64b8b4a","6becaa8d8ef875f3d1af3e073f21dfd5ee25a226","57a3b913fd3334b19c9d30e3cf1eddadbef0a229","6a4c6ac19d12da7857a2b620e5f8e778f22b732e","72dcbab7669a42f194b32912842130d5cfc770ab","4ff1e1c06344f6a74976fec5356ad2d64de44b2f","d5822d3e621307d4928b2bd20643640676b09495","2a96afaf3261a87f0daa51699b4b3cf169e092c4","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","29ffe33302fe9a8846967904ab5f030ec0cdd838","a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8","ba6961160c10bab1b37b89dbee65d91133ba4acf","c01f6960618c9b357832d6d654c6bc2af4c90b84","e3a589fee222fc7a3b21c0a0d8c98237d9fd0721","e3e3898502c9d64e1f78a567b737dc0048c03500","34f25a8704614163c4095b3ee2fc969b60de4698","0824550ffc8417d291f74c36a84b9082e91721aa","97efa3acd4a45b28f3c9e25c961a9379abdc811b","3bda8b8dd09117f7d5abc12cf4581ac50b6412ee","3f937fd4671c19675c0674eb1ef727cb4a4969fe","1da2dd2b7ff075e4676f5ad11916e71028be6a2b"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7681df2a5493531c988f425de1210919b67e6b4a","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57186735","https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/134904/1/Final_Brain_IEEE_JBHI.pdf"],"venue":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","journalName":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","journalVolume":"23","journalPages":"1911-1919","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2018.2874033","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2018.2874033","pmid":"30295634","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2895056585","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"497b6e4a7ba2e009f520d288537d6501fa4e33ae","title":"Classificatin of Brain Tumors by Machine Learning Algorithms","paperAbstract":"Brain tumors are one of the most important causes of death among cancer types.

The main purpose of machine learning and classification algorithms is to learn automatically from training and finally make a wise decision with high accuracy. In this study, the performances of tumor classification methods for the classification of MR brain image features as n/a, multifocal, multicentric and gliomatosis were analyzed. In the classification process, the statistical properties of the input images were analyzed and the data were systematically divided into various categories. These data were tested with KNN (k nearest neighbor), RF(random forest), SVM(support vector machines) and LDA(linear discriminant analysis) machine learning algorithms. SVM (support vector machines) algorithm with 90% accuracy rate was found to be better compared to other algorithms.","authors":[{"name":"Gökalp  Çınarer","ids":["2005584514"]},{"name":"Bülent Gürsel Emiroğlu","ids":["2892825"]}],"inCitations":["f44ff246a7ea4f743722f933839e2c56ffd95086"],"outCitations":["65a69968bb8c41aad0113cec4c2d981bddf50bc8","1518b4e60a4e30ec060aefc29256213140c7b93f","9f82379e823972d39da9d673f43d6f164b53796f","28a69390580af0a7ad63ce24c9cba0ea4e4d5233","9e232d7bb393f51a544561d82a76df418d47eedd","f1970c6435ba2a50df81cbb1688c5fe0851ad336","e0b7a64a0b943ab29a45f00f968e244cbbe1dbc2","ca2bfcf88873cce70e92b160bf0b6a2472c2fee7","7b7c0230a2d4f6e88a7e82ed10b5b969f27791aa","f7faba638847a526c77d75f38f2278224aab363e","251c39c1b9372f3055cd53d0001fc122bfb2e418","239d2a65da320e986cf5eec991fd3dee2bdec07d","c4830304939b7599abed7d44c50ea4af9d608e68","01a5abbee156183119d1e8b332fa7eddfe8e71f1","78053512af13466c569e5946acfc3953bbfc9d36"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/497b6e4a7ba2e009f520d288537d6501fa4e33ae","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2019 3rd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","journalName":"2019 3rd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-4","doi":"10.1109/ISMSIT.2019.8932878","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMSIT.2019.8932878","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2994715578","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"fbb77e6c73236e1af487079e96bcc7cdd11b5686","title":"Severity Level Classification of Brain Tumor based on MRI Images using Fractional-Chicken Swarm Optimization Algorithm","paperAbstract":"\n Brain tumor classification is highly effective in identifying and diagnosing the exact location of the tumor in the brain. The medical imaging system reported that early diagnosis and classification of the tumor increases the life of the human. Among various imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly used by clinical experts, as it offers contrast information of brain tumors. An effective classification method named fractional-chicken swarm optimization (fractional-CSO) is introduced to perform the severity-level tumor classification. Here, the chicken swarm behavior is merged with the derivative factor to enhance the accuracy of severity level classification. The optimal solution is obtained by updating the position of the rooster, which updates their location based on better fitness value. The brain images are pre-processed and the features are effectively extracted, and the cancer classification is carried out. Moreover, the severity level of tumor classification is performed using the deep recurrent neural network, which is trained by the proposed fractional-CSO algorithm. Moreover, the performance of the proposed fractional-CSO attained better performance in terms of the evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, specificity and sensitivity with the values of 93.35, 96 and 95% using simulated BRATS dataset, respectively.","authors":[{"name":"Dr R Cristin","ids":["2123676466"]},{"name":"Dr K Suresh Kumar","ids":["2124866511"]},{"name":"Dr P Anbhazhagan","ids":["2123672431"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["3b7d4875b975d6921115cb12915a2c78758663f5","d428634e562fc33ea7016401e646e504d82251dd","85434dcdf128c2e667d0a05a8799fe205d52e742","2e5859ec68ba4c922f55cf7891e165b420942de7","c2c1c205d623f19affc31c01265b1c696583e1ad","e870df2b08b47beead6e71403b68e6584e34cb9a","efea8031f35db276846809edef832dba1fa0ccc0","c83c72d26ca8d4152150f1ccbbb180542662cdfa","bc8de649b7f509a3a52a8fa9e9d67d957ebb8c62","c6e170b682077ca6bb5dd2b29957cfb7b556da41","cf1784b87add9138e0243d9e7ecb6535f31ba926","fc37722bb49bfb716f4baf546891d78077e8bfca","614eeb1f7758c04316ca2a8cd4a28756722d2b50","174f1fb5676893e7fc07cb5892e2f99312db96be","6ca26bebafd08c1a6ccebfef7c7f000bb0825829","0ab18d46496dbd6ffd6795d0911e07d19cbf6a9f","d21dca8d36ef08e62ae76f0140ec2f304a33e425","8af2ba2ddb9478a90c506073f5a57e90d1452d44","d476434c9c2679543253349e941fb2dbe8f6527d","4ae5e21ee2141de8da0597d452bfdf0376e03bf5","5038eabefad5cfaa606d3085c1654f697fb509fb"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fbb77e6c73236e1af487079e96bcc7cdd11b5686","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"The Computer Journal","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1093/COMJNL/BXAB057","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/COMJNL%2FBXAB057","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3169286888","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"5e8e72b32fcdeafe5098ef71d37a620eb4e9f6f4","title":"Brain Tumors Classification Based on 3D Shape","paperAbstract":"Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer death in children under 15 years and young adults up to the age of 34, early detection and correct treatments based on accurate diagnosis are important steps to improve disease outcome. In this paper, a new method for brain tumors identification based on quantitative three-dimensional shape analysis is proposed. According to the character of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and doctor’s clinical experience, we defined three two-dimensional shape descriptors correlating with tumor type from different points of view; on this basis, four three-dimensional shape descriptors were defined to realize the automatic classification of brain tumors. The experiment result demonstrates that these shape descriptors can well represent the tumor character. The classification accuracy of regular/irregular tumor is 93.93% and that of benign/malignant tumor is 87.14%. To regular benign (RB)/regular malignant (RM)/irregular benign (IB)/irregular malignant (IM), the classification accuracy is 86.43%. This method can be used as a clinical image analysis tool for doctors or radiologists to tumor identification.","authors":[{"name":"Peng  Wu","ids":["2111193425"]},{"name":"Kai  Xie","ids":["2057745946"]},{"name":"Yunping  Zheng","ids":["3088687"]},{"name":"Chao  Wu","ids":["2115424200"]}],"inCitations":["ad32ef1eab7597acc663c84243a2f941688954ca","1880ec0fd64a64eec0955be5234a3d96ec400a7f","ee63006ffba4cb5505e39e3a862c1934c911cc41","1e4cc73077f0172d695b9b9c3e8b19c37a92e360","f7bd7bb15cdcf0f265e762c67ccb77d896899a6a","ce0c19961bd6a7bab24ad8fa31d8ea756bc1daab","4de1e2553583baf45cef960bb25294ed6dc4ef88","224c76a43752bac5df72734352556f49968b4863","6bd462b3968c64410432dca27067234e321430b0","5741e6ea7da0e4baf1c9e4402d09bbd69ea5a605","6dbd4d847c9fc1c52a9034f44bfd8db8b8ce3559","708a4ccd83fc24adf305f844ed148f862bbb1f7d"],"outCitations":["10cb21d6373eda84d5660db5d8d7a35265e90169","747c6002686c66f2ef1b16a6d0142d0439ad050f","42bb76a8d786a8c2a53647ce161b099422873a51","f2be7f2bde75bf1b0980cdcc18c602567df1df5c","0fb14f4e380dd4db422d0b04bba5a906dcde8c1d","93b0bea585c4033cde6923fff37067fbfedb047e","0ffefa7d286b24f7c20bedf779cd7bc7d1f64ceb","df245f15947ab96e5a87ea2e4529e15d850feea1"],"year":2012,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5e8e72b32fcdeafe5098ef71d37a620eb4e9f6f4","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"277-283","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-29390-0_45","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-29390-0_45","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"218152074","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"46b3082333efcee429a83cd95a3c961f3d89b98b","title":"Brain Tumor Segmentation through Region-based, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Methods: A Literature Survey Brain Tumor Segmentation through Image Processing Methods: A Literature Survey","paperAbstract":"Image segmentation is one of the most trending fields in the domain of digital image processing.

In these medical imaging modalities, accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation is extremely imperative to perform safe diagnose, healthy treatment planning and consistent treatment outcome evaluation in order to understand and cure the complexities of chronic diseases such as Cancer. This paper presents various image processing techniques that are currently being used for brain tumor extraction from medical images.

According to deep learning model, a novel brain tumor segmentation method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNN) and dense micro-block difference feature (DMDF) into a unified framework so as to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. Firstly, we propose a local feature to describe the rotation invariant property of the texture. In order to deal with the change of rotation and scale in texture image, Fisher vector encoding method is used to analyze the texture feature, which can combine with the scale information without increasing the dimension of the local feature. The obtained local features have strong robustness to rotation and gray intensity variation. Then, the non-quantifiable local feature is fused to the FCNN to perform fine boundary segmentation. Since brain tumors occupy a small portion of the image, deconvolutional layers are designed with skip connections to obtain a high quality feature map. Compared with the traditional MRI brain tumor segmentation methods, the experimental results show that the segmentation accuracy and stability has been greatly improved. Average Dice index can be up to 90.98%. And the proposed method has very high real-time performance, where brain tumor image can segment within 1 s.","authors":[{"name":"Wu  Deng","ids":["2066620305"]},{"name":"Qinke  Shi","ids":["104353768"]},{"name":"Kai  Luo","ids":["2053593314"]},{"name":"Yi  Yang","ids":["46285511"]},{"name":"Ning  Ning","ids":["1500406092"]}],"inCitations":["db6691e1907eae329ccf74cef99fa1d1622555a8","519cb6dbefe9802cfab16dee7a89cd82db2f654f","5a4fb6362f6b04e04491f275aff05038a0023793","8f90c84b64e42bf0deacc25c8b8676b1aca7729d","b6e682aaf2e33a9d2bcf869c639030ef90f790d6","ca0f15b5ca1821a00a6981e973ff1a1af9ea276a","6138f03560cd4689664fa1125cc537c3d59711e0","28ca093633d75e61c920b2d06acfbf7fbd8442e1","09acde7016cf72820dca3064ef8853797326c174","cff0c93a6a372e239a8de20283a464460c610941"],"outCitations":["024ee1cbba7d9f1aac27e4e694bd08278dccb410","18731f85a3041aa33ddacc9c4aac843b102c98bf","fad303c1b3dce144d4491eb7e69924a6f0a47d0a","cdfcaae99a4060ab811b62b5b56cc3527d7b8ba5","a2182c4d0e8722d40ee50a097f5fc72a8a1fc8ad","ba6961160c10bab1b37b89dbee65d91133ba4acf","0824550ffc8417d291f74c36a84b9082e91721aa","1da2dd2b7ff075e4676f5ad11916e71028be6a2b","1b6278a321d4833b924fe8106a37e49af965ccdc","c01f6960618c9b357832d6d654c6bc2af4c90b84","2145f5cbac48df8ed9f7695606c34e98b26cf5a9","21eac8b9491b92718222fb53b34abd8346fa9d5e","787e4527ad230ea039ba5cad17fb361551dfc3bf","36bb0e6596cb1cd984c0194d9f5150bd3960da4e","976e29fe6c9baeb39732bca0e35f66f84d5bdd90","976050a0d225313224bd74f1608d20c5ac35577f","f5ab76d5ed339662a6be2685b9a08532ad7c43ac","15c4f33fd0587d1dae318cd068217a6dd55be636","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","f152c978f189165c1f095729b8eeeabbcb2edc4c","580b4ba6c0c182f3118de0626960b0281da2bea2","d84b51650ff22a0a8a77ca8b6a32bf62df448132","302a9b844fe11eed11e25ab88c41e80f19c8837a","e0067a9c3f30aab46d9e6f8844dc36e83c85869f","39f3b1804b8df5be645a1dcb4a876e128385d9be","fa39a47bc6bf818fca48c78fafc0aab1f0dc357f","d54134dd0ee1000c5eef6a8298f446b0a122b76a","21fe83935193a306b02f5c8eb6bfe51cbb547be9","02d3241705318f4326716261d7c64c133bf56f86","1ebfbec72391eba4530a4b38bb5f26bd49956c7b","288dbc40c027af002298b38954d648fddd4e2fd3","0c61ec71283220d60afd19fda78a759da9c77557","5858405d733758bbc353cf502c85979bb62ab852","18c125ce0f64e85577f7d30132cf0e92ec664bf4"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/25da5348b7db8f5ead7daa87304256a82c1a5bd6","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q90259422"],"venue":"Journal of Medical Systems","journalName":"Journal of Medical Systems","journalVolume":"43","journalPages":"1-9","doi":"10.1007/s10916-019-1289-2","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-019-1289-2","pmid":"31016467","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2942407711","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"bf4ec0da2cc152b99a3c7fdd4849a977d6976bdf","title":"A Big Data Analytics Approach in Medical Imaging Segmentation Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","paperAbstract":"Big data analytics uncovers hidden patterns, correlations and other insights by examining large amounts of data. Deep Learning can play a role in developing solutions from large datasets, and is an important tool in the big data analytics toolbox. Deep Learning has been recently employed to solve various problems in computer vision and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on visual recognition tasks. In medical imaging, especially in brain tumor cancer diagnosis and treatment plan development, accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role. In this chapter, we describe brain tumor segmentation using Deep Learning. We constructed a 6-layer Dense Convolutional Network, which connects each layer to every subsequent layer in a feed-forward fashion. This specific connectivity architecture ensures the maximum information flow between layers in the network and strengthens the feature propagation from layer to layer. We show how this arrangement increases the efficiency during training and the accuracy of the results. We have trained and evaluated our method based on the imaging data provided by the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) 2017. The described method is able to segment the whole tumor (WT) region of the high-grade brain tumor gliomas using T1 Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) and with excellent segmentation results.","authors":[{"name":"Zheng  Zhang","ids":["145527565"]},{"name":"David  Odaibo","ids":["73174420"]},{"name":"Frank M.

It helps them to identify the disease and to develop new drugs and strategies. The authors have designed a model called B-Map. It can detect and segmenting any foreign object in the brain using fuzzy rules. The model can detect objects such as cancer and brain tumor. The proposed work aims at designing a classifier. The classifier would help to detect all possible foreign objects using one application. B-Map has been compared with benchmark algorithms such as K-means and ANN. It was found that the proposed model performs significantly better than the current techniques. Original patients’ sample reports are taken from various medical laboratories. Graphical abstract The figure numbers are retained as in the paper. The proposed model is able to find the edges and segment different types of foreign objects or one can say unexpected developments. Figure 12 shows the outer edges of a section of a brain MRI. The patient’s MRI very clearly shows Hydrocephalus. The same is segmented and shown in Fig. 13. Figure 14 shows a segment of benign development and 15 shows a cancerous development which are again successfully segmented by the proposed model. The data on which testing is done is clinical data of the original patients. As the patient's details and data cannot be shared the author's cannot upload the data in the repository. As soon as the research completes, a benchmark dataset will be created and uploaded in public domain so that researchers can access it.","authors":[{"name":"Dev  Baloni","ids":["98689797"]},{"name":"Shashi Kant Verma","ids":["2114073574"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2b68e077efcc3e6ea1472a069dd34761419937f4","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s11517-021-02367-1"],"venue":"Medical Biol.

features","paperAbstract":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and lethal primary brain cancer. Due to its therapeutic resistance and aggressiveness, clinical management is challenging. This study aims to develop a machine-learning-based classification method using radiomic features of multiparametric MRI to correctly identify high grade (HG) and low grade (LG) GBMs. Multiparametric MRI of 50 patients with GBM, 25 HG and 25 LG, were used. Each patient has T1, contrast-enhanced T1, T2 and FLAIR MRI, as well as provided tumor contours. These tumor contours were used to extract features from the multiparametric MRI. Once these features have been extracted, the most significant and informative features were selected to train random forests to differentiate HG and LG GBMs while varying feature correlation limits were applied to remove redundant features. Then leave-one-out cross-validation random forests were applied to the dataset to classify HG or LG GBMs. The prediction accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC) were obtained at each correlation limit to evaluate the performance of our machine-learning-based classification. The best performing parameters predicted on an average, a prediction accuracy of 0.920 or 46 out of 50 patients, 22/25 for HGG and 24/25 for LGG, consistently with an AUC of 0.962. We investigated the process of distinguishing between HG GBM and LG GBM using multiparametric MRI, radiomic features, and machine learning. The result of our study shows that grade of GBM could be predicted accurately and consistently using the proposed machine-learning-based radiomics approach.","authors":[{"name":"Ge  Cui","ids":["2059218144"]},{"name":"Jiwoong Jason Jeong","ids":["51229107"]},{"name":"Yang  Lei","ids":["49381364"]},{"name":"Tonghe  Wang","ids":["83100564"]},{"name":"Tian  Liu","ids":["145836604"]},{"name":"Walter J.

These small particles (mean diameter <5 nm) have the highest Gd density of all paramagnetic contrast agents. They generate strong positive contrast enhancement in T(1)-weighted MRI. Signal enhancement is modulated by the interactions of water molecules with Gd, and very small particles provide the optimal surface-to-volume ratios necessary to reach high relaxivities. Conventional Gd(2)O(3) nanocrystal synthesis techniques, and subsequent polyethylene glycol (PEG) grafting procedures are usually time-consuming and recovery losses are also limitative. The present study reports on a new, fast, and efficient one-pot Gd(2)O(3) synthesis technique that provides PEGylated nanoparticles of very small size (mean diameter = 1.3 nm). Readily coated with PEG, the particles are colloidally stable in aqueous media and provide high longitudial relaxivities and small r(2)/r(1) ratios (r(1) = 14.2 mM(-1) s(-1) at 60 MHz; r(2)/r(1) = 1.20), ideal for T(1)-weighted MRI. In this study, F98 brain cancer cells (glioblastoma multiforme) were labeled with the contrast agent and implanted in vivo (mice brains). The labeled cells appeared positively contrasted at least 48 h after implantation. Each one of the implanted animals developed a brain tumor. The performance of PEG-Gd(2)O(3) was also compared with that of commercially available iron oxide nanoparticles. This study demonstrated that ultrasmall PEG-Gd(2)O(3) nanoparticles provide strong positive contrast enhancement in T(1)-weighted imaging, and allow the visualization of labeled cells implanted in vivo.","authors":[{"name":"Luc  Faucher","ids":["2089364787"]},{"name":"Mélanie  Tremblay","ids":["13885625"]},{"name":"Jean  Lagueux","ids":["10005725"]},{"name":"Yves

segmentation method based on a cellular automata model","paperAbstract":"Despite of the development of advanced segmentation techniques, achieving accurate and reproducible gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation results is still an important challenge in neuro-radiosurgery. Nowadays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most prominent modality in radiation therapy for soft-tissue anatomical districts. Gamma Knife stereotactic neuro-radiosurgery is a minimally invasive technology for dealing with inaccessible or insufficiently treated tumors with traditional surgery or radiotherapy. During a treatment planning phase, the GTV is generally contoured by experienced neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists using fully manual segmentation procedures on MR images. Unfortunately, this operative methodology is definitely time-expensive and operator-dependent. Delineation result repeatability, in terms of both intra- and inter-operator reliability, can be achieved only by using computer-assisted approaches. In this paper a novel semi-automatic seeded image segmentation method, based on a cellular automata model, for MRI brain cancer detection and delineation is proposed. This approach, called GTVcut, employs an adaptive seed selection strategy and helps to segment the GTV, by identifying the target volume to be treated using the Gamma Knife device. The accuracy of GTVcut was evaluated on a dataset composed of 32 brain cancers, using both spatial overlap-based and distance-based metrics. The achieved experimental results are very reproducible, showing the effectiveness and the clinical feasibility of the proposed approach.","authors":[{"name":"Leonardo  Rundo","ids":["2142430"]},{"name":"Carmelo  Militello","ids":["48480903"]},{"name":"Giorgio  Russo","ids":["11801405"]},{"name":"Salvatore  Vitabile","ids":["1801538"]},{"name":"Maria Carla Gilardi","ids":["145407843"]},{"name":"Giancarlo  Mauri","ids":["1747770"]}],"inCitations":["bb5eacd541b0b1d9541be08758d26eb7577d70ba","296b3bdc9d03597b47ef48ae9bd107cb793b0615","0843cc25e0afb6f190fc3119d3b80e941c476921","6989679f0e9bc95b827ac989cda6f8b391a72172","de4707c99e0591291cdadc90cc8c5d94f068dfb0","79fc3d94ffd3af18532959a2e161e2422d090e34","cc69bdb645d1e763903cb4893e0d4857a623704b","a82dd07100355718ff2d4c6ec9aa467c2aed5423","149e350b36836fb0c8a4904c7a2f2a3b1c62116d","3f95b6ff3fda46db7fae313f5412759b86da0341","7f733e71f1144f36e5c47204e52ab6eed8d7fa75","0799c67f0f4aabf2ab1828e5c72053d4a7e6bc2a","b6fb43535fabadc31a25f1333e231dd4a95a9a5b","44f4f850d65c5c1eade8f2d08bc6188e7d244197","0ca4ad71483746c299d48df31b5d19cc15f240b0","a6484014cade2c17e7be33e7aa8324bb23331df0","c0543b0a19c6ad34c0058481e1bf5e6624ada37b","05c990990256fab09af63d8df96e23a573adf7bb","18ed3f8ba910cb60898be064fbd9a2cea89e6a1b"],"outCitations":["d88018141ec7e436829d38a09ac8b01d4eab4d89","8a1a89841ad0797dc16f5a823e1cfe9c1baf1bf5","3a35746fa5e848c785ad9b9d986d58f5a951bf5e","f026c92b1d91a97aa3c8fcda026fe0217c49dde9","d9448e6d1bad1152c3a2e46e2e95e6fc46a1ded7","62c185ab3aee441637f66d5dc16cde19b8994753","b7406a2f2abf9aefdaf632864d5075301223d02f","a811bafbddbe72d3d53ab491b2e9bc45a22a75f7","e385c0d9ddc60ac19dcfed987c5e8529fc899dcc","7eae4f35a2b15be6daf388b390639be74789c2a0","59d86a93c4ef54b5489bc375cd02e64205823f42","decdb275f139373409ee15a0c17b9adf8de69f00","f8b3142bf319f9d2c54fd5dca2cad3bda3a1cc32","f26d35d2e32934150cd27b030d4d769942126184","e4179ac27a92410dbd9e83da4679d9d53a37f8b2","12a9fd5ccaace0b274cbc201586fefe6aa856d29","5aed377296c948186ae7d41b319d04a054ea88c7","151baae6666d5887460536029b0179366cff3e67","eadb9abcff07d56c62975cac4b73d148ec2fb14d","56f44a60caa2687186ef18fd0dc9a7a531c174ae","322afdd019bf1394b2b60879b7f777bfaee18fb8","28eb47f734827e62a480c9259113d461e5630713","4e8d670587ffcc476035138c9c078e92074088f3","4e234772b283e9e274791ed25911c20e08e6c462","0d7436e3f9f8d32956b0c66021c462e8a7b9aecd","17087920305ae1cc7dc97a26948f4f33a6d24d28","9c85c6abf6bc508cd2f0ac00a1efe3dbf9fa2889","db6d0d90c71e8c2b978afa0c3f448119cfa8b093","7f784e326c1f222649fe1ecc90e5314a741eff17","3120324069ec20eed853d3f9bbbceb32e4173b93","005eddda6f315e0078324ab6e0e4376a24f768c9","befec0618a3ed5bed4e61a93575cf041abf7e1b7","f935b29784eaadf36c8d7e409d723d57b5e7ad67","4e607b44337fe7160cb4f4ce153332c7e53964a7","1d4816c612e38dac86f2149af667a5581686cdef","2c940efc1737698aef752a302a1133799e393e35","4697b29af0d3c85049f5e338f62a28b3fec821e5","4f8d648c52edf74e41b0996128aa536e13cc7e82","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","e37ec6967dee6ab93b6d60f24a077a25377d6f26","d18f7490693c9993e67724c7c3aac7e6b3668f77","3121653ca578201b868542724dd167ed0e19d297","e69764d312adb05a2202ab187c983cd334dfd26e","55e7430c4dcd19a2a759e2af44380aaa0b8b4cd8","979043880f846eafaa2ce122412ce55b0a5693d3","eb1ad9e90b8d9290fb3134da87f2883e99199482","81df596d48ada1ee2abd8c24cf0e86da95e300ed","7a10f26b6fefe20c48dc931fcd3deeb3fc693f39","67e477926e116000b3f264e61a026e7504919535","472926026ffb6b6fe878c4349ea9f1e2520f3bf6","222c68fc80b05064680ddc467243b620604fd11e","204630a97055818bab2d90fd1a6709d62f8523ad","829a6606d8cb2d5bbf3b3ede8e52842729db66a0","d8c86bd895d8271f9618966b7e95643b793980ba","2876d002780ab8632c4e5fecb917038e8997359c","fa39a47bc6bf818fca48c78fafc0aab1f0dc357f","64a877d135db3acbc23c295367927176f332595f","1175608cde3de3d3b6e17aea53ccbafbda6eb638","a4cec122a08216fe8a3bc19b22e78fbaea096256","b8449883e99755250a5a8fa3c12a9b4bdf677e12","a3e90ffc21fd42e36ab37d4cc8f81d9c7b0fde92","967746aa9d1d273745bbc25416346fad3bca54e1","c1383701b79efb77904e411639733fa296125190","5ffe5dd803f8ebc9cd9fa7808f3e6a8cd860ddb9","a57520b68e73b5e1fc3668b443daf74ebe957cc7"],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7c1d409ebff65e47c960599cf64cb41c609232a7","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57518176"],"venue":"Natural Computing","journalName":"Natural Computing","journalVolume":"17","journalPages":"521-536","doi":"10.1007/s11047-017-9636-z","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11047-017-9636-z","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2740481439","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"d6561fdac9b62f4d9acd217ffea103ff6143d3d9","title":"Developing a Halbach array for targeted drug delivery to brain tumours","paperAbstract":"Introduction \nMalignant brain tumours constitute a small proportion of annual cancer incidence; however, the death rate is almost double the rate of incidence of all cases of cancer. This is not helped by the difficulties associated with the delivery of drugs to the brain. Steering magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) i.e. superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in an area of interest has been proposed for directing magnetically labelled drugs to clinical targets. A powerful magnetic and field gradient is required to ensure that the drugs are directed to the target area. In this case, the deeper the location, the stronger the magnetic force required. External permanent magnets can provide a strong magnetic field and gradient. We hypothesise that an inexpensive, portable, powerful and external Halbach array of 1.1T can be designed to steer SPIONs into brain tumours for drug delivery. \nMethodology \nComputational model: A 2-D simulation model of a Neodymium-iron-boron (FeNdB-52) magnet was run using Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) software. \nIn vitro model: The FEMM model was assembled and produced a Halbach array with a magnetic strength of 1.1T. The Halbach array was placed on the top of a 3D printed head in order to trap SPIONs (Fe3O4) in a 3D tumour, in contact with the surface of the head model. SPIONs were run through a fluid flow system using a syringe pump at 10 ml/min. The experiment was performed in two parts; the first part was to flow SPIONs with different concentrations ranging from 0.1mg/ml to 20mg/ml. The second part was to flow SPIONs, with the same concentrations, but loaded with 50 million white blood cells (WBCs) to mimic circulation. The concentration of SPIONs was quantified by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP). Images of the tumours with trapped MNPs were also obtained by MRI (3T) using a dual gradient echo sequence (TE= 4.60ms, 20ms). The uptake of SPIONs and viability of brain cells as well as brain tumour cells was evaluated using TEM and flow cytometry. \nFindings \nThe strength of the modelled magnetic arrays was 1.6T whereas the actual assembled one was 1.1T assessed using Gaussmeter. The concentration of trapped SPIONs in the phantom flow model was different depending on the initial concentration of SPIONs and the location of the tumours within the head phantom. As expected, the further away the tumour was from the magnet, the less SPIONs were trapped. Trapping was confirmed by both ICP and MRI. The SPIONs uptake was observed in the cytoplasm of the cells and it was also noted that increasing the concentration of MNPs resulted in increased toxicity of the brain cells and brain tumour cells. This suggests that the concentration of iron needed to guide drugs with minimal toxicity should be considered. \nConclusions \nVarious Halbach array designs were modelled and an optimised design assembled. The in vitro experiments showed that the Halbach arrays could trap SPIONs with or without WBCs inside the tumour at different distances- up to 10 cm. This suggests that Halbach arrays have the potential to trap therapeutic drugs labelled with iron particles and we believe this would be useful for targeting of anti-cancer therapies to brain tumours.","authors":[{"name":"Areej

the treatment of malignant glioma.","paperAbstract":"UNLABELLED\nA major obstacle to the management of malignant glioma is the inability to effectively deliver therapeutic agent to the tumor. In this study, we describe a polymeric nanoparticle vector that not only delivers viable therapeutic, but can also be tracked in vivo using MRI. Nanoparticles, produced by a non-emulsion technique, were fabricated to carry iron oxide within the shell and the chemotherapeutic agent, temozolomide (TMZ), as the payload. Nanoparticle properties were characterized and subsequently their endocytosis-mediated uptake by glioma cells was demonstrated. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) can disperse nanoparticles through the rodent brain and their distribution is accurately visualized by MRI. Infusion of nanoparticles does not result in observable animal toxicity relative to control. CED of TMZ-bearing nanoparticles prolongs the survival of animals with intracranial xenografts compared to control. In conclusion, the described nanoparticle vector represents a unique multifunctional platform that can be used for image-guided treatment of malignant glioma.\n\n\nFROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR\nGBM remains one of the most notoriously treatment-unresponsive cancer types. In this study, a multifunctional nanoparticle-based temozolomide delivery system was demonstrated to possess enhanced treatment efficacy in a rodent xenograft GBM model, with the added benefit of MRI-based tracking via the incorporation of iron oxide as a T2* contrast material in the nanoparticles.","authors":[{"name":"Giovanna M Bernal","ids":["4219664"]},{"name":"Michael J

CAD system assists the doctors for the diagnosis of diseases in higher degree of perfection within a short period of time. Now CAD is the most preferable method for the initial diagnosis of cancer using X-ray, CT, mammogram or MRI images. CAD works as an intermediate in between the radiologist and the input images. The output from CAD doesn't think about as a final result however used as a reference for more tests in the relevant field. In fact CAD helps the doctors for detection of cancer more precisely and early. The combination of artificial intelligence, digital image processing technique and radiological image processing etc makes the CAD system more reliable and efficient. Sensitivity, specificity, absolute detection rate etc are the important parameters of the CAD system. Now CAD system is mostly used for breast cancer detection, lung cancer detection, colon cancer, coronary artery disease, congenital heart defect, lung cancer, bone cancer, brain tumor etc. Any part of body can affect cancer and very high possibility to spread other parts. These days CAD system developed to a great extends, however it's not reached to 100% accuracy. In this article that discusses the necessary options, motivation, findings from the early developments and future expansions of CAD systems.","authors":[{"name":"P. Y.

There is evidence from other solid organ cancers and metastases that DWI may be used as a biomarker of prognosis and treatment response. We therefore investigated DWI characteristics of cerebral metastases and their peritumoral region recorded pre-operatively and related these to patient outcomes.MethodsRetrospective analysis of 76 cases operated upon at a single institution with DWI performed pre-operatively at 1.5T. Maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were generated using standard protocols. Readings were taken from the tumor, peritumoral region and across the brain-tumor interface. Patient outcomes were overall survival and time to local recurrence.ResultsA minimum ADC greater than 919.4 × 10-6 mm2/s within a metastasis predicted longer overall survival regardless of adjuvant therapies. This was not simply due to differences between the types of primary cancer because the effect was observed even in a subgroup of 36 patients with the same primary, non-small cell lung cancer. The change in diffusion across the tumor border and into peritumoral brain was measured by the “ADC transition coefficient” or ATC and this was more strongly predictive than ADC readings alone. Metastases with a sharp change in diffusion across their border (ATC >0.279) showed shorter overall survival compared to those with a more diffuse edge. The ATC was the only imaging measurement which independently predicted overall survival in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 – 0.97, p = 0.04).ConclusionsDWI demonstrates changes in the tumor, across the tumor edge and in the peritumoral region which may not be visible on conventional MRI and this may be useful in predicting patient outcomes for operated cerebral metastases.","authors":[{"name":"Rasheed  Zakaria","ids":["2324405"]},{"name":"Kumar  Das","ids":["144101220"]},{"name":"Mark  Radon","ids":["33750167"]},{"name":"Maneesh  Bhojak","ids":["2795235"]},{"name":"Philip R.

For knowledge discovery from this diagnostic data, efficient data mining techniques play a very important role. Ensemble classifier is one of the data classification techniques related to data mining, in which decision of multiple base classifiers is combined for accurate prediction of the presence or absence of abnormality. Here, we have considered retinal images of diabetic patients, PET scan of brain of Alzheimer and MRI of brain cancer and classification is performed irrespective of whether normality or abnormality is present. The ensemble method proves to be very efficient in classification of records from available patient database, as it involves the process of considering opinion from multiple base classifiers, as opposed to the single classifier method. This leads to very accurate and precise inference, as uncorrelated errors are removed because of multiple base classifiers.","authors":[{"name":"Sarika  Pachange","ids":["31046150"]},{"name":"Bela  Joglekar","ids":["9459617"]},{"name":"Parag  Kulkarni","ids":["145397234"]}],"inCitations":["21d0f846f903ed7473db468a7aefdeba0b9da1e4","85df5b7cf9d3ef2f8754424bdce6dbdbe439c397","433fc13e03ba667ea151f54c0a0fb21e6b17f05c"],"outCitations":["e30a47911cfb98934dc640eb669b9351827bd37b","6344cc3da1782e74acbb38cbca57a0dd2654c414","5c30543a9cf84ea06f897e821da44f9acaa5e3f3","2c18fac0361e69431bfe84229d20af8b5b99c2a0","ec0415b12e6a8e9a04683b548d79e1d0f37da1d0","c27e5a9214a493d3596e42e2aaab033322200b65","b23cfcec62d1ad97f1c852e92681f0a64322982a","664ddbca74d828f127c59de826b59ea1ec80a010","00e6e664ca482a9346d149d926f25a05c3b084c9","d7580c73c32cd5dead268bca205635d225b642a5","7e28aad3e4ce2052ef502740407da875d6296215","93dc85ba701a94a4356e1d8d3cb4a4e9aaccfdf7","13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986","043ed2d51f6660ffebae5abb02761b534e96bd5c","efe603f4c5edf217dadf4cc05ae852ce67237f9f","976e29fe6c9baeb39732bca0e35f66f84d5bdd90","2627594338be2ab823b8e8643467adfec84afd38","9248800298ea6d89c36d2f97127dfec831b2e243","5b808a669fdf39c1056039d9b7f9bd1c4fcd73f8","8c8659c91842a365165e7821bcce76a6751bc044","77422eb5ea055860a9c7ff2c5200182fdc27bc7b"],"year":2015,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2265514ace75160b6677993b706b8cdc3e27bd3a","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2015 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","journalName":"2015 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-5","doi":"10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443826","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443826","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2341549717","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"c7beac24b3394c6190b1e84777d15bf2314c470d","title":"Data sampling imbalance with steerable wavelets for abnormality detection in brain images","paperAbstract":"A long standing goal within artificial intelligence application for medical imaging has been the ability for appropriate detecting abnormalities in MRI image of brains to support early diagnostics of cancer. This paper presents a solution relying on analysis of class imbalance in data sampling from brain image database instead of error statistics to improve accuracy of the abnormality detection. Here we use modification of training data set both for minority class and majority class to overcome under-segmentation and over-segmentation in detection of abnormality where abnormality is seen as minority class but its distribution is assumed unknown. In this approach, steerable wavelet based features are encoded with machine learning methods to allow the study of data sampling imbalance. In order to increase the detection sensitivity a set of wavelet features is selected from a number of feature sets in the learning task. The results with a benchmark medical image database show the effectiveness of the proposed method for abnormality detection in brain images.","authors":[{"name":"Dao Nam Anh","ids":["2959361"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["bba55a61e9b33325a9ddd4a889d2c476facf131d","9b5ff2b9d1031c7632cd1e10d6d600e4d0de7550","23045299013e8738bc8eff73827ef8de256aef66","12e7b7756c9c2339b44a4c1e9ce618e9c9e227a8","8cb44f06586f609a29d9b496cc752ec01475dffe","2232b37dfd91570165122724464d19c2afc8be00","74cc72bae68362dfa027f9ce444352597876a1be","26850e2fd94d5839f09b9d715d9e0012cccaf5d3","ebe5b9a24275793de12cb367802db19690751f41","5ff135450ae462855df27f44ad76872de5f1d1ea","f7db4fa742118e4811071468c4ac5a74b5b2581f","0421c3afe37ad35ff36b7a9b1d8da3ee68275be3","f8697512702784eae2d8f1b7e29c6b2632e2b2fa","82c1077d1badb6f96c42ef47256a486ba8bc9575","71b5e8d9970f3b725127eb7da3d5183b921ad017","5f3bbb2ff46445a7638fcbb3a2de727e36974923","4130e4e00b52f8947a671116f2fd029cce8cac79","4e607b44337fe7160cb4f4ce153332c7e53964a7","ccbf582c177aee79ad4ff6b2a4f2cfad94a41c8e","0d13100c04aa3ffff8b42f939abcfb3c03d6e04e","629db0cf595805e92ca1088b90730366926efd29","5c69da9862e34ca9871ec7f5a255380409b7ee24","9a3f9d1d86a8f080dca8414ac1b1ff8e0478276d"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c7beac24b3394c6190b1e84777d15bf2314c470d","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2018 2nd International Conference on Recent Advances in Signal Processing, Telecommunications & Computing (SigTelCom)","journalName":"2018 2nd International Conference on Recent Advances in Signal Processing, Telecommunications & Computing (SigTelCom)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"158-163","doi":"10.1109/SIGTELCOM.2018.8325782","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIGTELCOM.2018.8325782","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2794454167","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"eec690ae2af65ae804d01df656403aa5be1a20f4","title":"A novel FPGA-based system for Tumor Growth Prediction","paperAbstract":"An emerging trend in the biomedical community is to create models that take advantage of the increasing available computational power, in order to manage and analyze new biological data as well as to model complex biological processes.

One major challenge of applying this technology for clinical application is the lack of site-specific carriers that can effectively deliver short interfering RNA (siRNA) to cancer cells. Here we report the development and assessment of a cancer-cell specific magnetic nanovector construct for efficient siRNA delivery and non-invasive monitoring through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The base of the nanovector construct is comprised of a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle core coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-grafted chitosan, and polyethylenimine (PEI). The construct was then further functionalized with siRNA and a tumor-targeting peptide, chlorotoxin (CTX), to improve tumor specificity and potency. Flow cytometry, quantitative RT-PCR, and fluorescence microscopy analyses confirmed receptor-mediated cellular internalization of nanovectors and enhanced gene knockdown through targeted siRNA delivery. The ability of this nanovector construct to generate specific contrast enhancement of glioblastoma cells was demonstrated through MR imaging. These findings suggest that this CTX enabled nanoparticle carrier may be well suited for delivery of RNAi therapeutics to brain cancer cells.","authors":[{"name":"Omid  Veiseh","ids":["4942817"]},{"name":"Forrest M.

treating electric fields or TTFields are emerging as a new treatment modality for cancer, and its first FDA-approved use is in glioblastoma patients. TTFields are alternating electric fields at 200 kHz continuously delivered by the Optune device to the scalp of patients. Preclinical experiments have shown that they interfere with dividing cancer cells as they undergo metaphase-to-anaphase transition in mitosis and, specifically, they disrupt α/β tubulin and septin proteins that have high dipole moments. However, the visualization of TTFields in the brain and therefore treatment verification require complex computational simulation and modeling of electromagnetic wave propagation, which entails added difficulties due to the different conductivity and relative permittivity values of various intracranial tissues and cavities. The procedure requires segmenting tissue structures as seen on the MRI, generating a 3-dimensional mesh for each segmented volume, and importing the composite mesh into a finite element solver of Maxwell’s equations. In turn, the finite element analysis process involves the identification and application of material parameters to different segmented tissue types, specification of appropriate boundary and initial conditions, as well as identification of the best fit solution for the electric field distribution, all of which are dependent on the transducer array layout as generated by proprietary NovoTAL computer software. Ultimately, the precise visualization of the TTFields in the glioblastoma and adjacent brain tissues may enable neuro-oncologists and physicist to improve TTField delivery in the brain.","authors":[{"name":"Edwin  Lok","ids":["50365818"]},{"name":"Eric T.

The ADC value changes measured during pre- and posttherapy interval are closely correlated to treatment response. This work was demonstrated using a voxel-based analysis of ADC change during therapy in the brains of both rats and humans, following rigidly registering pre- and post-therapeutic ADC MRI exams. The primary goal of this paper is to extend this voxel-by-voxel analysis to assess therapeutic response in breast cancer. Nonlinear registration (with higher degrees of freedom) between the pre- and post-treatment exams is needed to ensure that the corresponding voxels actually contain similar cellular partial contributions due to soft tissue deformations in the breast and compartmental tumor changes during treatment as well. With limited data sets, we have observed the correlation between changes of ADC values and treatment response also exists in breast cancers. With diffusion scans acquired at three different timepoints (pre-treatment, early post-treatment and late post-treatment), we have also shown that ADC changes across responders within 5 weeks are a function of time interval after the initiation of treatment. Comparison of the experimental results with pathology shows that ADC changes can be used to evaluate early response of breast cancer treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Bing  Ma","ids":["145423627"]},{"name":"Charles R.

Existing CT synthesis methods are able to synthesize normal tissues but are unable to accurately synthesize abnormal tissues (i.e., tumor), thus providing a suboptimal solution. We propose a multiatlas- based hybrid synthesis approach that combines multi-atlas registration and patch-based synthesis to accurately synthesize both normal and abnormal tissues. Multi-parametric atlas MR images are registered to the target MR images by multi-channel deformable registration, from which the atlas CT images are deformed and fused by locally-weighted averaging using a structural similarity measure (SSIM). Synthetic MR images are also computed from the registered atlas MRIs by using the same weights used for the CT synthesis; these are compared to the target patient MRIs allowing for the assessment of the CT synthesis fidelity. Poor synthesis regions are automatically detected based on the fidelity measure and refined by a patch-based synthesis. The proposed approach was tested on brain cancer patient data, and showed a noticeable improvement for the tumor region.","authors":[{"name":"Junghoon  Lee","ids":["2118598808"]},{"name":"Aaron  Carass","ids":["1755681"]},{"name":"Amod  Jog","ids":["1880139"]},{"name":"Can  Zhao","ids":["150068346"]},{"name":"Jerry L.

In this study we functionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle surface with two PEG differing in their length (n = 23 and 44) and terminal functionality, COOH and CH3. By varying the ratio of the two different PEG, we optimized the molecular architecture of the nanoplatform to obtain maximum stability and low toxicity under physiological conditions. The best nanoplatform was evaluated as MRI contrast for mouse brain vascularization imaging at 7 T. The carboxylic acid functions of the nanoplatform were used to covalently bind an antibody, Ab. This antibody, labeled with a fluorophore, targets the ETA receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in the endothelin axis and overexpressed in various solid tumours, including ovarian, prostate, colon, breast, bladder and lung cancers. In vitro studies, performed by flow cytometry and magnetic quantification, showed the targeting efficiency of the Ab-nanoplatforms.

Even though brain tumour is not considered as the primary cause of mortality worldwide, 40% of other types of cancer (such as lung or breast cancers) are transformed into brain tumours due to metastasis. Although the biopsy is considered as the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, it poses several challenges such as low sensitivity/specificity, risk during the biopsy procedure, and relatively long waiting times for the biopsy results. Due to an increase in the sheer volume of patients with brain tumours, there is a need for a non-invasive, automatic computer-aided diagnosis tool that can automatically diagnose and estimate the grade of a tumour accurately within a few seconds.\n\n\nMETHOD\nFive clinically relevant multiclass datasets (two-, three-, four-, five-, and six-class) were designed. A transfer-learning-based Artificial Intelligence paradigm using a Convolutional Neural Network (CCN) was proposed and led to higher performance in brain tumour grading/classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We benchmarked the transfer-learning-based CNN model against six different machine learning (ML) classification methods, namely Decision Tree, Linear Discrimination, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbour, and Ensemble.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe CNN-based deep learning (DL) model outperforms the six types of ML models when considering five types of multiclass tumour datasets. These five types of data are two-, three-, four-, five, and six-class. The CNN-based AlexNet transfer learning system yielded mean accuracies derived from three kinds of cross-validation protocols (K2, K5, and K10) of 100, 95.97, 96.65, 87.14, and 93.74%, respectively. The mean areas under the curve of DL and ML were found to be 0.99 and 0.87, respectively, for p < 0.0001, and DL showed a 12.12% improvement over ML. Multiclass datasets were benchmarked against the TT protocol (where training and testing samples are the same). The optimal model was validated using a statistical method of a tumour separation index and verified on synthetic data consisting of eight classes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe transfer-learning-based AI system is useful in multiclass brain tumour grading and shows better performance than ML systems.","authors":[{"name":"Gopal S.

Due to many differences in the shape and appearance, accurate segmentation of glioma for identifying all parts of the tumor and its surrounding tissues in cancer detection is a challenging task in cancer detection. In recent researches, the combination of atlas-based segmentation and machine learning methods have presented superior performance over other automatic brain MRI segmentation algorithms. To overcome the side effects of limited existing information on atlas-based segmentation, and the long training and the time consuming phase of learning methods, we proposed a semi-supervised learning framework by introducing a probabilistic graph based method. It combines the advantages of label propagation and patch-based segmentation on a parametric graph. To evaluate the proposed framework, we apply it to publicly available BRATS datasets, including low and high-grade glioma tumors. The experimental results show that the proposed framework has accurate segmentation results. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed framework could obtain the best dice score for segmenting the “whole tumor” (WT) and “tumor core” (TC) regions. The segmentation result of the “enhancing active tumor” (ET) region is similar to the most recent works compared in this paper.","authors":[{"name":"Zeynab  Barzegar","ids":["2109109"]},{"name":"Mansour  Jamzad","ids":["1740732"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["c36bbfa0e2feb2a5d37f293448583321a8ae235d","32c42de64130b3b8b012360f7c4ce87903bb4298","9b6f5e4cb8f2163fe400f1315bca976623e33b28","241dcc168c2c6a1a764e28ae26dec9fc20061423","e13d5337ffa8dc4b2b6ec2b1909a2583125b4b03","3ac1f8964dc07e9ff393b78956bd215a40badddf","31e4d6291aab0d793f2d76a2b5e6dd68cb1b9d36","91dd71a59ea17f71e10ff1a933c8cd18f208344b","0f55559d2d6bf5eec43da7ef5ba75b8a03ad2a5c","c83a3c6214571b75cc3c4321ac7c4d63820456d3","de77746c7af999504fc15ee59fad7527d06207af","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","b3991f2dcf9ab3f50f593b4e87b8e77127e57f8c","da74769ff7af1bb80ff89d730377a5328e1d7b71","eae2e0fa72e898c289365c0af16daf57a7a6cf40","f57a033f7f46d6be84b371b881979fab55e7faba","5602e3c0ed94f00ffc71dcedfbb085efe8d2b02b","89d4eaf0b38523322c891ed159229ae89f2aaaef","c83c72d26ca8d4152150f1ccbbb180542662cdfa","877aa1ab656e586529e9ea8f9978f987a5f02f62","f0f313f5a54c4fa04e14893120341ebed1289546","99dcdea9df99b551e685dfe0e07d2538f0eb2d21","e7ada65cc33a892b14abe1c00d8eb1710cfaed95","685dca5083db2a2e85ca216e930a246108c07986","b0dac601a9fc416d40ddfd49f2ed26f563561a09","72d612233a341ef6126b71957b4697fc0bb1acbe","04a453d871c9b5680bfef6d595ecfc0b414c58cc","ab67ae1bb895f1f9608664037bd5d057c5a9786d","1f4a2b82b1bd77aac1ba11a7b90178631b30f5d1","da7ab6e7a2e4595b35ce670264544792224fe11f","dc5ea5e17aacdc1915c4a4f562f311b789b2f673","08d676e2f8f3b171a04e24d38a0fd76312c5366c","510ca89dafa2c434f130fdd7c456ece10b9967a7"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/541b54287065eae85751f2f11613f3fa385c03e8","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102617"],"venue":"Biomed.

Padhani Paul Strickland Scanner Centre, Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex HA6 2RN, United Kingdom, Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex HA6 2RN, United Kingdom, CRUK Clinical MR Research Group, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5PT, United Kingdom Introduction: Quantitative flow parameters such as relative blood flow, relative blood volume and mean transit time, measured using dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted MRI (T2*w DCE-MRI) have to date been acquired mainly in brain tumours. This is partially due to the difficulty of performing the high time resolution scans in motion artefact-prone areas, and partially because of high first pass extraction of low molecular weight contrast media in visceral tumours. Calculating the parameters also requires the use of a complex gamma-variate fitting algorithm. A simpler and more widely implementable method for analysing brain T2*w DCE-MRI tumour data has been suggested by Liu et al. who calculated the relative maximal signal drop (rMSD: Figure 1) and compared it with a fully calculated relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and mean transit time (MTT). They noted that rMSD provided equivalent information to rCBV in leaky brain tumours provided that MTT was not substantially prolonged. In this study, we compare rMSD with gamma-variate based quantitative analysis in breast cancer patients, both before and after 2 courses of FEC (5-Fluorouracil, Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy. Methods: 29 patients with invasive breast cancers were imaged preand post-FEC chemotherapy using a single slice T2*w DCE-MRI protocol (TE 20ms, TR 30ms, flip angle 40) with 0.2 mmol/kg bw Gd-DTPA being administered after the first 10 of 60 images, time resolution 2s. Fifteen minutes before this was done, they had undergone a T1w DCE-MRI examination with 0.1mmol/kg Gd-DTPA. Pixel-by-pixel analysis to calculate rBV, rBF and MTT via a gamma variate fit was performed using MRIW software (Institute of Cancer Research, London). In-house software was used to calculate the normalised relative maximal signal drop (rMSD) from baseline (=100*(So-Smin)/So), also on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Regions of interest (ROIs) on the whole tumour outline were drawn. rBV and rBF were plotted for all tumour pixels in each patient and linear regressions performed to evaluate the spread of MTT. A similar analysis was performed on a patient-by-patient basis correlating rBV/rBF with median rMSD values both preand post-chemotherapy. Results: Figure 1 shows a T2*w signal intensity-time curve for invasive ductal breast cancer with a gamma-variate fit and relative maximal signal drop. Pre-treatment rBF/rBV regression gave a mean R of 0.916 ± 0.146 and post-treatment regression gave a mean R of 0.938 ± 0.071 for all patients. When patients were split into responders (r) and non-responders (nr), the pre-treatment R values were 0.992 (r) and 0.936 (nr) (Figure 2a), and post-treatment R values were 0.948 (r) and 0.995 (nr). Figures 2b and 2c show the patient-by-patient correlation comparing median rMSD with (b) pre-chemo rBV (R=0.867) and (c) post-chemo rBV (R=0.315). Pre-chemo rBF had R=0.894 and post-chemo rBF R=0.405. Discussion: The signal intensity (SI) for the breast patients (Figure 1) does not return to baseline, in common with extra-cranial tumours. This is due primarily to susceptibility effects induced by contrast medium pooling in the extravascular extracellular space (EES), and recirculating in the vasculature. Since rBV is the integral of the contrast/time curve (assuming a return to baseline), a gamma variate is fitted to the data to compensate for the non-return, and the integration carried out on the fit. Any effects of T1 enhancement caused by contrast medium in the EES were minimised by ‘pre-loading’ the EES with contrast medium from a prior T1w DCE-MRI measurement (with 0.1mmol/kg Gd-DTPA dose). There is little difference between the rBF and rBV correlations for both preand post-FEC chemotherapy, and between responders and non-responders. This indicates that the MTTs are not significantly prolonged. For pre-treatment tumours, the relative maximal signal drop in susceptibility-weighted DCE-MRI can be used to indicate the perfusion status of breast cancers and could be used as an alternative to more complex gamma-variate perfusion calculations. However, in the post-treatment setting, rMSD is not as good an indicator of blood volume or flow, irrespective of response category.","authors":[{"name":"Nj  Taylor","ids":["144988741"]},{"name":"Ml  Ah-See","ids":["1403061264"]},{"name":"J.

A number of pathologies (e.g. subtypes of breast cancer) have different histologic phenotypes but similar radiographic appearances. While texture features have been previously employed for distinguishing subtly different pathologies, they attempt to capture differences in global intensity patterns. In this paper we attempt to model CoLlAGe to identify higher order co-occurrence patterns of gradient tensors at a pixel level. The assumption behind this new feature is that different pathologies, even though they may have very similar overall texture and appearance on imaging, at a local scale, will have different co-occurring patterns with respect to gradient orientations. We demonstrate the utility of CoLIAGe in distinguishing two subtly different types of pathologies on MRI in the context of brain tumors and breast cancer. In the first problem, we look at CoLlAGe for distinguishing radiation effects from recurrent brain tumors over a cohort of 40 studies, and in the second, discriminating different molecular subtypes of breast cancer over a cohort of 73 studies. For both these challenging cohorts, CoLlAGe was found to have significantly improved classification performance, as compared to the traditional texture features such as Haralick, Gabor, local binary patterns, and histogram of gradients.","authors":[{"name":"Prateek  Prasanna","ids":["39017169"]},{"name":"Pallavi  Tiwari","ids":["2344884"]},{"name":"Anant  Madabhushi","ids":["1705442"]}],"inCitations":["50315f1c8c88ecd49232728e15b2ddd6d1393ea3","73d491704a20ac0db6c26cb9715b2f6bc165c9cd","6408836505c85a6f4c0bfa7a2150b94939f42f0b","53f114f4e43c3d5040aede67b68c9b5277e0281a","fb815f5d5cee6cd88513f8526a61ad3989b24e91","b4d7e0755cf21619f4b510e6c52258b37d64c271","b662aed0b78346b954f182dd0afb4e8ca40c29be","e785dd169d6041cb132f7357e950c3c095d442f7","652dea2a5e9b491b7284e0436d40ff465c9f1ccf","2a172c6b7b69959a0dc2aca34b4b0062f82d9aeb","71036a5e1489276628175390f82effb306adbced","4e0cb2d4acdc52d89327c9d2a674af9937213376","3cd53804f4596cae71c6024d591ca8e71a8d2020","2625afa806526fb19e27ead53026562ecd1ee2a5","517f76c5c0c8dd5837d61a34be435f1ae6904931","2a636dabcce101b252b5fc63471ad9a8079cb748","90814b180ca9897aba175de190b422437fce7dd7","e6c9cdb2ad5e31214fce3698e52642796c91dfe9"],"outCitations":["cec734d7097ab6b1e60d95228ffd64248eb89d66","a0a41d30cd7eed54c714d9088319c86220e0f30a","88604d333e83a1f6a37d41a20af8302095345b0b","f1790099f259c81439a1d11c4cdbde7753e8d2eb","5794141889d0e994c3103b0aaab08a18222c9c43","52ae924ff208b308315600bad8260c972d1ca5e9","1fdb62555eb650662dbe2a6f3985d390861597c2","f8c8619ea7d68e604e40b814b40c72888a755e95","f11a7136b6b7854bd0998ef463ffa8e907c411a2"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e294c7c58fee5a81d09c6b0cabee6d3d25e9f81f","sources":["DBLP","Medline"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q85805594"],"venue":"MICCAI","journalName":"Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Each modality of the MRI, such as T1, T2, T2C, Flair, and DW has its own merit and demerits. Hence, in the proposed work, a unique computer-assisted technique (CAT) is proposed to evaluate the abnormalities in MR images, irrespective of its modalities. Proposed CAT has the following stages: (i) Discrete Wavelet Transform Based Principal Component Averaging (DWT-PCA) image fusion, (ii) Tri-level thresholding based on Social Group Optimization and Shannon’s entropy, and (iii) Watershed segmentation. This approach is experimentally assessed with MICCAI brain cancer segmentation (BRATS 2013) challenge database. Experimental results confirms that the proposed approach is efficient in offering better values of Jaccard (84.33%), Dice (90.86%), sensitivity (99.93%), specificity (90.67%), and accuracy (95.74%) compared with the single modality registered brain MR images. Hence, the proposed work is extremely significant for the segmentation of abnormal region from the brain MR images registered using Flair, T1C, and T2 modalities.","authors":[{"name":"V.

However, the biological relationship underpinning these predictive models has been largely unstudied, with the generalizability of these models also called into question. Here, we examine the localized relationship between MR-derived radiomic features and histology-derived histomic features using a dataset of 16 brain cancer patients. Tile-based radiomics features were collected on T1W, post-contrast T1W, FLAIR, and DWI-derived ADC images acquired prior to patient death, with analogous histomic features collected for autopsy samples co-registered to the MRI. Features were collected for each original image, as well as a 3D wavelet decomposition of each image, resulting in 837 features per MR image and histology image. Correlative analyses were used to assess the degree of association between radiomic-histomic pairs for each MRI. The influence of several confounds were also assessed using linear mixed effect models for the normalized radiomic-histomic distance, testing for main effects of scanners from different vendors and acquisition field strength. Results as a whole were largely heterogenous, but several features demonstrated substantial associations with their histomic analogs, particularly those derived from the FLAIR and post-contrast T1W images. These most-associated features typically presented as stable across confounding factors as well. These data suggest that a subset of radiomic features are able to consistently capture texture information about the underlying tissue histology.","authors":[{"name":"Samuel  Bobholz","ids":["1626352213"]},{"name":"Allison  Lowman","ids":["84478033"]},{"name":"Alexander  Barrington","ids":["153250563"]},{"name":"Michael  Brehler","ids":["2023617"]},{"name":"Sean  McGarry","ids":["40074839"]},{"name":"Elizabeth J.

Image segmentation is a popularly identified technique that is employed to extricate unnatural tissues in medical images. There is a chance of a tumor getting converted into lethal cancer which is a significant leading cause of loss of life. This can be detected accurately by using magnetic resonance imaging images(MRI) in an automatic system. It will also consume less time in detecting the tumor. Automating the entire method of detection the tumor at an initial stage helps to cure it quicker. The proposed work includes using magnetic resonance(MRI) images which will be enhanced by performing the mentioned Pre-Processing techniques like thresholding, watershed and other morphological operations which would help us in identifying and detecting the tumor. The features would be extracted and a delta graph will be generated which will help us in creating a 3D model of the brain. The 3D model helps the doctors to make a decision which kind of cure operation is to be performed and therefore gain a deeper insight. The proposed work will also classify the detected tumor into Begin or Malignant with the help of K-means and Artificial Neural Network. Also, the growth of the brain tumor will be tracked with the help of differential analysis. The projected technique will be implemented with the aid of MATLAB R2018b.","authors":[{"name":"Aman  Doshi","ids":["2064164322"]},{"name":"Miloni  Shash","ids":["115049312"]},{"name":"Sonia  Patel","ids":["152264229"]},{"name":"Zaheed  Shaikh","ids":["144685527"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["1de94d4889f0ea88629f030bf9f6a3e5869e19e0","5eb03378d11882df750ed85742398942a9d11b03","0be448f70869bd71497607200d3ccc991603d0c0","a690a6c4233470d112ad9fdc4dbc755c380bf355","eab1540a465b06d242c67facf18d9062183d7044","05b093f2b2f85a4d080c588e26a85f971dae93b6","dc8970b9d74f2720a4bdc64c341b3b13a1665621","3ba0a70201c3de28ce685efac2677a2c52e16987","ae46f15e7a7b574c8409bce8b7ad320fb30694c7","8d4db502d78b339c1ca4adbdcbc6660000bf8052","e536a8cb6c3523f2e4e19605578128a2272c31c2","5ba76528af3d7e4398721305f027c266d3904b42","e5e77d6977c75ec4afa7250caba4c2e0fba27099"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/38c498bc175403c2eda8faff188b0e028ac4ab4d","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume181/number50/30496-30496-2019918617?format=pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Computer Applications","journalVolume":"181","journalPages":"5-8","doi":"10.5120/IJCA2019918617","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5120/IJCA2019918617","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2938178956","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"0ed298b8bab398bcda22f62a1a49719894799536","title":"Sodium 3D COncentration MApping (COMA 3D) using (23)Na and proton MRI.","paperAbstract":"Functional changes of sodium 3D MRI signals were converted into millimolar concentration changes using an open-source fully automated MATLAB toolbox. These concentration changes are visualized via 3D sodium concentration maps, and they are overlaid over conventional 3D proton images to provide high-resolution co-registration for easy correlation of functional changes to anatomical regions. Nearly 5000/h concentration maps were generated on a personal computer (ca. 2012) using 21.1T 3D sodium MRI brain images of live rats with spatial resolution of 0.8×0.8×0.8 mm(3) and imaging matrices of 60×60×60. The produced concentration maps allowed for non-invasive quantitative measurement of in vivo sodium concentration in the normal rat brain as a functional response to migraine-like conditions. The presented work can also be applied to sodium-associated changes in migraine, cancer, and other metabolic abnormalities that can be sensed by molecular imaging. The MATLAB toolbox allows for automated image analysis of the 3D images acquired on the Bruker platform and can be extended to other imaging platforms. The resulting images are presented in a form of series of 2D slices in all three dimensions in native MATLAB and PDF formats.

transfer imaging in brain metastasis of lung cancer","paperAbstract":"BackgroundLung cancer brain metastases are very common and one of the common causes of treatment failure. We aimed to examine the clinical use of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) technology in the evaluation of brain metastases for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis.MethodsWe included26 cases of lung cancer brain metastases, 15 cases of gliomas, and 20 cases with normal tests. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR;3.5 ppm) image from the GRE-EPI-CEST sequence was analyzed using the ASSET technique and APT technology. The MTR values were measured in the lesion-parenchymal, edema, and non-focus regions, and the MTR image was compared with the conventional MRI. ANOVA and t-test were used for statistical analysis.ResultsThe lesion-parenchymal, edema, and non-focus areas in the metastatic-tumor-group were red-yellow, yellow-green, and green-blue, and the MTR values were 3.29 ± 1.14%,1.28 ± 0.36%,and 1.26 ± 0.31%, respectively. However, in the glioma-group, the corresponding areas were red, red-yellow, and green-blue, and the MTR values were 6.29 ± 1.58%, 2.87 ± 0.65%, and 1.03 ± 0.30%, respectively. The MTR values of the corresponding areas in the normal-group were 1.07 ± 0.22%,1.04 ± 0.23%, and 1.06 ± 0.24%, respectively. Traditional MR images are in black-white contrast and no metabolic information is displayed.The MTRvalues of the three regions were significantly different among the three groups. The values were also significantly different between the parenchymal and edema areas in the metastatic-tumor-group. There were significant differences in the MTR values between the non-lesion and edema regions, but there was no significant difference between the edema and non-focus areas. In the glioma-group, there were significant differences in the MTR values between the parenchymal and edema areas, between the parenchymal and non-focus areas, and between the edema and non-focus areas.ConclusionsCEST reflects the protein metabolism; therefore, early diagnosis of brain metastases and assessment of the prognosis can be achieved using molecular imaging.","authors":[{"name":"Yonggui  Yang","ids":["2472033"]},{"name":"Xiaobo  Qu","ids":["3344382"]},{"name":"Yihui  Huang","ids":["2108607332"]},{"name":"Khan  Afsar","ids":["2103516970"]},{"name":"Gen  Yan","ids":["116058102"]},{"name":"Gang  Guo","ids":["2067613440"]},{"name":"Shaoyin  Duan","ids":["122784105"]}],"inCitations":["4befaed723f582c79434a9a6eb1d161cfaa296eb"],"outCitations":["af7ffdc115090f628ff996ffebbca5ea0fb1f025","f56c3151a5a4c636869a820db2486c8e330ae553","60d50e1194c073cfe1070cdf645889abcf0f7d48","f4d581855be180c38a281b4d7ea97581a46ed2d9","10908cb58f3c301839604f2489e1dd20b94cd777","0e138a4b1eb2d538f8f4e97eff64db2915831c07","51575d4500e7b22e59357c5534d46fe20edfa1f7","2d95470de5418a696eca8cab4b1b95caa7d2e504","575f4e7cfa0c052c6f41aca9452de1105c81bf7c","1ec22855cfad5a8443cc67fb8e61248016798261","b8d3db065febe55a8c0c76a1bd421f4cde8b7cb8","165634fe7719828aba2d7fa3d12c4ee6c2aef653","a22b0e9f34306fee30872b03eec15ee19d19808e","176c83fa424a4e7d61eb8b91ca1a27cb35c545cc","5f7181184417123bae417f813507d6cc0f50c29b"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cdbef96fb3dd9e30c5dc0d221446bd2cd9635cd4","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12880-019-0400-y","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q92604537"],"venue":"BMC Medical Imaging","journalName":"BMC Medical Imaging","journalVolume":"20","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1186/s12880-019-0400-y","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-019-0400-y","pmid":"31931731","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Computer Science"],"magId":"3003611405","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"2a79fcfd8018d81dc997dc239920f52025b5c872","title":"An Open-Source Tool for Anisotropic Radiation Therapy Planning in Neuro-oncology Using DW-MRI Tractography","paperAbstract":"There is evidence from histopathological studies that glioma tumor cells migrate preferentially along large white matter bundles. If the peritumoral white matter structures can be used to predict the likely trajectory of migrating tumor cells outside of the surgical margin, then this information could be used to inform the delineation of radiation therapy (RT) targets. In theory, an anisotropic expansion that takes large white matter bundle anatomy into account may maximize the chances of treating migrating cancer cells and minimize the amount of brain tissue exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) can be used in combination with fiber tracking algorithms to model the trajectory of large white matter pathways using the direction and magnitude of water movement in tissue. The method presented here is a tool for translating a DW-MRI fiber tracking (tractography) dataset into a white matter path length (WMPL) map that assigns each voxel the shortest distance along a streamline back to a specified region of interest (ROI). We present an open-source WMPL tool, implemented in the package Diffusion Imaging in Python (DIPY), and code to convert the resulting WMPL map to anisotropic contours for RT in a commercial treatment planning system. This proof-of-concept lays the groundwork for future studies to evaluate the clinical value of incorporating tractography modeling into treatment planning.","authors":[{"name":"Kesshi  Jordan","ids":["19661013"]},{"name":"Olivier  Morin","ids":["10291282"]},{"name":"Michael  Wahl","ids":["143650604"]},{"name":"Bagrat  Amirbekian","ids":["3310586"]},{"name":"Christopher H.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) gives important information about the internal structure of the human brain. This paper proposes an effective detection of brain tumour using thresholding and watershed segmentation algorithm. Thresholding is the simplest segmentation method through which thepixels arepartitioned depending on their intensity value.Watershed segmentation pays particular attention to the boundary situations. Statistical features are extracted from the segmented image. In the proposed work thresholding is applied on features to obtain the effective detection of brain tumour. I.INTRODUCTION A tumour is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Tumours that are located within the brain are called brain tumours and can be classified into two categories such as Primary Brain Tumours and Secondary Brain Tumours. Glioblastomamultiforme (GBM) is the most lethal and aggressive form of primary brain tumour. It is a grade IV type of brain tumour. Median survival for patients with glioblastoma is 12-15months. GBM is derived from the malignant transformation ofglialcells. Medical imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of GBM. Typically post-contrast magnetic resonance(MR) imaging is used for diagnosis followed by biopsy for pathological validation. The current standard of care for patients with GBM is surgicalresection of the tumour followed by radiation therapy. Radiation therapy damages the genetic material (DNA)within tumour cells and limits their ability to successfully reproduce. Tumour cells areless able to repair DNA than healthy cells. Radiation injury (RI) is an undesirable but unavoidable side effect of radiation treatment. Brain metastasis is common among patients with systemic cancer.Approximately 150,000 brain metastases are diagnosed. Brain metastasis (MET) is thought to occur when the primary tumour acquires the ability to migrate away from the primary site and travels to the brain.The most common origins of brain metastasis are breast cancer, melanoma and lung cancer. Metastasis often causes severe neurological symptoms. Treatment assessment is critical for measuring tumour response to therapy. Thedevelopment of contrast-enhanced CT and MR imaging has allowed radiologists to assess therapeutic response more accurately and reproducibly in patients with brain tumours .Advanced CT and MRI techniques are currently being used in research settings as response assessment tools for brain tumour patients and are based on detecting cellular changes, and detecting changes in metabolic and hemodynamic activity. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section II deals with related works of brain tumour detection. Section III describes the proposed work. Section IV discusses the experimental results. Finally, Section V concludes the work. II.RELATED WORK Komal Sharma and Akwinder Kaur proposed the work on brain tumour detection system based on machine learning algorithms. The texture features of the image considered in this proposed work include energy, contrast, correlation, homogeneity.The maximum accuracy 98.6% and 91.6% is achieved by considering 212 samples of brain MR images. This accuracy can probably be increased by considering a large data set [10][1] .Priyanka, Balwinder Singhconducted a research for accurate detection of brain tumor using clustering techniques thus giving efficient end results for detection of tumors[8] S. M. Ali, Loay Kadom Abood, and Rabab SaadoonAbdoon proposed the method which performs better than the existing works. Feature extraction was done by using gray level co-occurrence matrix(GLCM) and image was segmented using k-means clustering which gives effective results[2][7]. Nagesh Subbanna and Doina Precup presented a new iterative, multi-stage graphical model framework aimed at segmenting pathology Comparison of the segmentation results of the proposed method was presented on the live challenge website [6] for entire tumour, tumour core and enhanced tumour for real, clinical cases. Their technique outperformed the winner by about 25% for tumour cores, and by about 5% for enhancing tumours[3].

Though many registration algorithms are developed and applied on human brain volumes, these methods may not be as efficient on small animal datasets due to lack of intensity information and often the high anisotropy in voxel dimensions. Therefore, a fully automatic registration algorithm which can register not only assumably rigid small animal volumes such as brain but also deformable organs such as kidney, cardiac and chest is developed using a combination of global affine and local B-spline transformation models in which mutual information is used as a similarity criterion. The global affine registration uses a multi-resolution pyramid on image volumes of 3 levels whereas in local B-spline registration, a multi-resolution scheme is applied on the B-spline grid of 2 levels on the finest resolution of the image volumes in which only the transform itself is affected rather than the image volumes. Since mutual information lacks sufficient spatial information, PCA is used to inject it by estimating initial translation and rotation parameters. It is computationally efficient since it is implemented using C++ and ITK library, and is qualitatively and quantitatively shown that this PCA-initialized global registration followed by local registration is in close agreement with expert manual registration and outperforms the one without PCA initialization tested on small animal brain and kidney.","authors":[{"name":"Nathanael L.

Since there is always possibility of multiplication of cancer cells and recurrence of cancer tumors after first treatments taken, such as surgery, patients are highly recommended to get follow-ups examinations, such as MRIs. Number of MRIs per year depends on the type and location of the firstly diagnosed tumor but based on patients health status specialist may cut down on number of annual MRIs year by year. However this may be dangerous because it is possible for the patients to have a recurrence of tumor after some years and since there is a few MRIs taken every year, tumor may grow fast or become in an inoperable position. In this regard, we suggest doing spatio-temporal data mining, using medical information of similar patients as input data, to determine when the most high-risk time to get another tumor is. In order to do such analysis effective criteria, such as patient age, type of tumor, location of tumor, amount of residual tumor, etc. should be considered. This paper suggested mining the information of patients with brain tumor as one of the most dangerous types of cancer.","authors":[{"name":"Anahid  Basiri","ids":["48338097"]},{"name":"Adam Winstanley Pouria Amirian","ids":["69893914"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2013,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0b52463415627f1dc08c917033a18d7a84f14575","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"DICTAP 2013","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"197-199","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"1603616102","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"576b4ebb31f78db34427afada4d6b4448b2895f2","title":"Segmentation of lung vessels using radon transform","paperAbstract":"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer- related deaths in the world. For the detection of lung cancer, pulmonary CT (computed tomography) image processing is required. Discrimination of vessels from other organs in the lung is required for the detection of lung nodules. This is an important step in the diagnosis of lung cancer since the size and shape of the nodules indicate the severity of lung cancer in the patient. Therefore, vessel segmentation has received a large amount of interest, and a variety of techniques have been proposed for this task. Vessel detection techniques have been widely used in brain MRI images and retinal images, and have been shown to apply to segmentation of lung vessels as well. Radon transform is a technique which transforms line-containing images to a radon transform domain where every line is represented as a peak or a valley. This helps to understand the intensity and position of the lines in the image. This technique has shown success in the segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images, and in this paper, we use it for the segmentation of lung vessels. Pre-processed lung CT images are partitioned and further processed. The Radon transform is then applied. Vessel mask parameters are defined and analyzed to obtain a final vessel map highlighting the blood vessels in the source lung CT image.","authors":[{"name":"K. T.

However, to simplify the learning process, traditional settings often assume datasets with equally distributed classes, which clearly does not reflect a typical distribution. In this paper, we investigate the problem of mining knowledge from an imbalanced dataset (i.e., a skewed distribution) to predict survival time. In particular, we propose an algorithmic framework to predict survival groups of brain tumor patients using multi-modality MRI data. Both an imbalanced distribution and classifier design are jointly considered: 1) We used the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique to compensate for the imbalanced distribution; 2) A predictive linear regression model was adopted to learn a pair of class-specific dictionaries, which were derived from reformulated balanced data. We tested the proposed framework using a dataset of 42 patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) tumors whose scans were obtained from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved 95.24% accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"Mu  Zhou","ids":["48993866"]},{"name":"Lawrence O. Hall","ids":["25887296"]},{"name":"Dmitry B.

Various image processing and pattern identification techniques can be used for tumor identification and classification process. Deep learning is evolving technique under machine learning that provides the advantage for automatically extracting the features from the images. The computer aided diagnosis system proposed in this research work can assist the radiologists in cancer tumor identification based on various facts and studies done previously. The system can expedite the process of identification even in earlier stages by adding up the facility of a second opinion which makes the process simpler and faster. In this paper, we have proposed a framework of convolution neural network (CNN), that is a technique under Deep Learning. The research work implements the framework on AlexNet and ZFNet architectures and have trained the system for tumor detection in lung nodules and well as brain. The accuracy for classification is more than 97% for both the architectures and both the datasets of lung CT and brain MRI images.","authors":[{"name":"Vipin  Makde","ids":["150332622"]},{"name":"Jenice  Bhavsar","ids":["150139494"]},{"name":"Swati  Jain","ids":["2109382649"]},{"name":"Priyanka  Sharma","ids":["2112284082"]}],"inCitations":["504357f7adc87902e0b1c41ed99f92eaf37daac3","d414dd8555d65b2bfd5bb62c868c4310a35acf80","dc598826f23aac74edc73b5893e064788b79cf43","4d379f788f0fabf8e7a5ba9b550fd0ba1ebef1af","72b5cffa223dc8b122d4dbbddeec160b10026c7a","fef3b3f24712de0234bfa12cc4e31d022a499594"],"outCitations":["29b7497534056472c2cb13f43b8bdcc5f9854c74","dce5383440cb7931335133c44ab7cd6e874eb649","86ab4cae682fbd49c5a5bedb630e5a40fa7529f6","94f50648bfc62d380c7cb6b81e17c8a81d7b7d6e","1a2a770d23b4a171fa81de62a78a3deb0588f238","a538b05ebb01a40323997629e171c91aa28b8e2f","2fd88c088f96d0f8cb92a144801131d0da51b204","06c8b4c1dd0c045bc6a08d0062c5042b5588d55b","ae044ab4b2f4c51d15c06d4be4e42d1b223c5e67","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","251c39c1b9372f3055cd53d0001fc122bfb2e418","1a57d2730131b7d106801ef49aa78b2eb21b7fc5","ce76fea215a40b7d538f1aaba4bb35f863764296"],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6a9c06bf81183e1cb2afee6a012bcae76bd511fb","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"199-206","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-63645-0_22","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-63645-0_22","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2745967536","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"6414ea60b00b5f547d2d2a8fb0d2121688bc0baf","title":"Brain tumor classification in MRI image using convolutional neural network.","paperAbstract":"Brain tumor is a severe cancer disease caused by uncontrollable and abnormal partitioning of cells. Recent progress in the field of deep learning has helped the health industry in Medical Imaging for Medical Diagnostic of many diseases. For Visual learning and Image Recognition, task CNN is the most prevalent and commonly used machine learning algorithm. Similarly, in our paper, we introduce the convolutional neural network (CNN) approach along with Data Augmentation and Image Processing to categorize brain MRI scan images into cancerous and non-cancerous. Using the transfer learning approach we compared the performance of our scratched CNN model with pre-trained VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inception-v3 models. As the experiment is tested on a very small dataset but the experimental result shows that our model accuracy result is very effective and have very low complexity rate by achieving 100% accuracy, while VGG-16 achieved 96%, ResNet-50 achieved 89% and Inception-V3 achieved 75% accuracy. Our model requires very less computational power and has much better accuracy results as compared to other pre-trained models.","authors":[{"name":"Hassan Ali Khan","ids":[]},{"name":"Wu  Jue","ids":["2120237789"]},{"name":"Muhammad  Mushtaq","ids":["145075991"]},{"name":"Muhammad Umer Mushtaq","ids":["2120198578"]}],"inCitations":["8f2a92c1e9a6c6ceee693579ecf7a568f6e6b199","1e7029217664b0db53edeb0ea329e23ce21e2a7a","f1f6ed7cf1b3441c66e9c105bdaa0e4a70c10289","4d8f0ae904779a50b2e18fec49e51a5661a98d8a","aa7d046eb247b5410ef483b99e56d708630190e9","5c107f5aa33e3e5d3b3ea9dc17e04a51765b0983","963d73e7d46725d462dfa5060ecf9e44fc005f97"],"outCitations":["a25fbcbbae1e8f79c4360d26aa11a3abf1a11972","6530f3dd82b4e63db5eba226a8bba1aa683efe78","a1f85d85a9a32bab9a8793421fa2bf7e3502924c","23ffaa0fe06eae05817f527a47ac3291077f9e58","b8504d447d358f48bc9e6b2d32314809794889c1","2c5597d67a0e1fc1e2353ce1130da466fb53e9a7","14ab9fe14d9d7ac9f60b2a4dbaa2f4ca6c77ce20","85fd1893d12cb41fe518ced9f04e427b75ee23d3","f066a6e3495984550863245f8e07485332e0ed65","5038eabefad5cfaa606d3085c1654f697fb509fb","f0be7f5ba10c8df0ea5ae5118a47fb26e93dc2e4","3813b88a4ec3c63919df47e9694b577f4691f7e5","e15cf50aa89fee8535703b9f9512fca5bfc43327","a538b05ebb01a40323997629e171c91aa28b8e2f","34ddd8865569c2c32dec9bf7ffc817ff42faaa01","fbbd3381640dae2ca4b03ac7ed85bfec896929b8"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6414ea60b00b5f547d2d2a8fb0d2121688bc0baf","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":["http://webmail.inb.uni-luebeck.de/inb-publications/pdfs/KhJuMuMu20.pdf"],"venue":"Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE","journalName":"Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE","journalVolume":"17 5","journalPages":"\n          6203-6216\n        ","doi":"10.3934/mbe.2020328","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020328","pmid":"33120595","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Computer Science"],"magId":"3084741591","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a47a1da5214b81e828e61a40cb402569234a9ddf","title":"Estrogen- and tamoxifen-associated effects on brain structure and function","paperAbstract":"We evaluated the effects of estrogen and tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, on positron emission tomography (PET) measures of brain glucose metabolism and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of hippocampal atrophy. Three groups of postmenopausal women were studied, women taking estrogen (ERT+), women with breast cancer taking tamoxifen (TAM), and women not taking estrogen or tamoxifen (ERT-). All subjects received a PET scan, an MRI scan, and cognitive testing. The TAM group showed widespread areas of hypometabolism in the inferior and dorsal lateral frontal lobes relative to the other two groups. The ERT- group showed lower metabolism in the inferior frontal cortex and temporal cortex with respect to the ERT+ group. The TAM group also showed significantly lower semantic memory scores than the other two groups. Finally, the TAM group had smaller right hippocampal volumes than the ERT+ group, an effect that was of borderline significance. Both right and left hippocampal volumes were significantly smaller than the ERT+ group when a single outlier was removed. The ERT- group had hippocampal volumes that were intermediate to the other two groups.

standard","paperAbstract":"Under the Digital Image and Communication\nin Medicine (DICOM) standard, the Advanced\nEncryption Standard (AES) is used to encrypt medical image pixel data. This highly sensitive data needs to be transmitted securely over networks to prevent data modification. Therefore, there is ongoing research into\nhow well encryption algorithms perform on medical images and whether they can be improved. In this paper, we have developed an algorithm using a chaotic map combined with AES and tested it against AES in its standard form. This comparison allowed us to analyse how the chaotic map affected the encryption quality. The\ndeveloped algorithm, CAT-AES, iterates through\nArnold’s cat map before encryption a certain number of times whereas, the standard AES encryption does not. Both algorithms were tested on two sets of 16-bit DICOM images: 20 brain MRI and 26 breast cancer MRI scans, using correlation coefficient and histogram uniformity for evaluation. The results showed improvements in the encryption quality. When encrypting\nthe images with CAT-AES, the histograms were more uniform, and the absolute correlation coefficient was closer to zero for the majority of images tested on.","authors":[{"name":"Ranvir Singh Bhogal","ids":["67314472"]},{"name":"Baihua  Li","ids":["2118424508"]},{"name":"Alastair  Gale","ids":["14667718"]},{"name":"Yan  Chen","ids":["38904968"]}],"inCitations":["83bc51c9d98d9faf2e3a7e86d45f7f2fa3d3d83f","77c4fee4e814547da719286918871a2d3d764669","e5fde11a088f893f346bb850fc253c283a0a75a8","71108bf9ec5d126820319373aeeda3be3cfb4969","c8e9f10b5b6535ca944ab6426fc0dfddb47fd536","4c4174e28b710775c3101c6159478659daf6f076","7be6c884f6394d086f1b17fba2ab01f528cceb05","15794522378277ddc49834a5723852b83f27bd8f","1623317affb5a2d5f6a17166a31cb9d406423c66"],"outCitations":["03a98b67ec03ea3af50f42bee5f0835704700b21","5c372cdaa88e7e6016b5084044e4eae82a0306e0","790ba503857f09de7760b5b29be59c62a991ec31","a49bb5e25a2e5372d44ae32d0e621bb68b0a85f5","65525e93fdbe931cf962b8190c7c125a737da111","ec51208534c2811785bc210994a57cdf94665383","769bd5482686a96b0e9a40ee65d95072f00e4c7f","c0a56f3e1dcbfdaade52f5a02b8da049e266c442","7913e0ff50613161222eead9fa4babbf6a0a1765","a93190f1331c8a17d882f96b0bf719fc85324467","1c60c75fc246bdb5b49df161d889d76a5dc0bd7a","105024ae7e7fd207e014e32e0466c42c865d944b","9bd62623c4cd3d97aff16a6ad81ea899fedf203c"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0158ee7e73e5d54235fc09b54fcb6ca7022e372a","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/34390/1/Medical%20Image%20Encryption%20using%20Chaotic%20Map%20Improved%20Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard.pdf","http://www.mecs-press.org/ijitcs/ijitcs-v10-n8/IJITCS-V10-N8-1.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Information Technology and Computer Science","journalVolume":"10","journalPages":"1-10","doi":"10.5815/IJITCS.2018.08.01","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5815/IJITCS.2018.08.01","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2887914688","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"9caf5467c6532b2f997a72d6e5ca6c138d65d671","title":"Image descriptors in radiology images: a systematic review","paperAbstract":"Clinical decisions are sometimes based on a variety of patient’s information such as: age, weight or information extracted from image exams, among others. Depending on the nature of the disease or anatomy, clinicians can base their decisions on different image exams like mammographies, positron emission tomography scans or magnetic resonance images. However, the analysis of those exams is far from a trivial task. Over the years, the use of image descriptors—computational algorithms that present a summarized description of image regions—became an important tool to assist the clinician in such tasks. This paper presents an overview of the use of image descriptors in healthcare contexts, attending to different image exams. In the making of this review, we analyzed over 70 studies related to the application of image descriptors of different natures—e.g., intensity, texture, shape—in medical image analysis. Four imaging modalities are featured: mammography, PET, CT and MRI. Pathologies typically covered by these modalities are addressed: breast masses and microcalcifications in mammograms, head and neck cancer and Alzheimer’s disease in the case of PET images, lung nodules regarding CTs and multiple sclerosis and brain tumors in the MRI section.","authors":[{"name":"Mariana A.

that grows out of control is one of the major causes for the increase in mortality among children and adults. Segmenting the regions of brain is the major challenge in tumor detection. A large number of effective segmentation algorithms have been used for segmentation in grey scale images ranging from simple edge-based methods to composite high-level approaches using modern and advanced pattern recognition approaches. Gradient vector field is an effective methodology applied to extract objects from complex backgrounds. The methodology has been effectively applied to extract different types of cancer like breast, skin, stomach etc. This paper uses a segmentation methodology called Gradient Vector Field, which uses energy as the feature to segment brain tumor along with a number of standard object detection algorithms mainly Sobel, Canny, Roberts, Prewitt and Laplacian. The performance of all the algorithms is tested on synthetic datasets followed by real MRI images. This paper (i) concludes the superiority of a particular methodology over others (ii) explains in detail the runtime analysis of the algorithms (iii) In depth analysis of the manual calculations of the parameters related to all the algorithms resulting into an optimized result with minimum error.","authors":[{"name":"Amarjot  Singh","ids":["48775489"]},{"name":"Shivesh  Bajpai","ids":["13837725"]},{"name":"Srikrishna  Karanam","ids":["1976152"]},{"name":"Akash  Choubey","ids":["33142051"]},{"name":"Thaluru  Raviteja","ids":["69896780"]}],"inCitations":["41c21c757a883381b5b275a0fddcf45111ec882a","82a7b744c071d164248713fd48a7b15af6161c1c","466a533ad3abb6bdaa3e8201944af10e877c0c46","1781b8607005c58c826429d65472141b81786ef3","9e09bc299871a3250967164bb13e225f5ba24e23","5d76cdf3a5a703ae8aefbe70eac51d67ca5e2884","b10f81111bc9743024329932d73846303c2da8e1","5d1d692b1df5f18c7a47c0d6e23f1b56fc7177e3","f5e8e12a4a533a3d504f92c0b8662a1a82b82c8e","9bd271b9a3699dcfa4fc63f5e19d136b344d8ee3","476a479be436348e5adb70e0a4f3c314a041d558","19566f9801b150770b432f7f30c33492507c288f","03c02895bcef7e205b254ac83d86b764a69396d7","9191f7637c7545a061d93ce59e729566cc6700b9","f2c89cac31c6ece2857098a8ebfecb8dff1ea9fb","e888e8ef942f2bb438b8f0d8fc326f58af293b84"],"outCitations":["9009c9685754346deb93f316144a9da1f70ffcd8","18836cbf140d542022ec5f04805fa47d9d0772f9","fcf9fc4e23b45345c2404ce7d6cb0fc9dea2c9ec","e6a5df5cd7f12f6bd328c6abddb83a1edc3608ff","9394a5d5adcb626128b6a42c8810b9505a3c6487","49d801198e791ebec06d8413617f1bc98744309a","c8c4a8f3344b8367c6a506509ff16b64f4824795","ab5387cf077f5b97c7dd08845c006e5c1ec89ff5","bcbde4f82a1d20da1a5d0d95a5a411b6432b0a85","86b13694a1e20bd4776b35952f4aee7992613c8a","4d79f7ebf833c549dd1429fd9440628d6c0824c3","717a3f8a49e95cdd2aa3dac0cb334c9b5204c26b","28ec1fe81dfc6eebe359898ff79960e24876032e","a704772b5846dac57c6d5bf4cbf2b9955663c9a1","9dce6d9f16b75671e42748f9835eb1dd8da2132d"],"year":2012,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/812be6cdb1957c7e7f3f1830814f1bf286c91cfe","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijcte.org/papers/626-A10135.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1002-1006","doi":"10.7763/IJCTE.2012.V4.626","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7763/IJCTE.2012.V4.626","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"1966663797","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a495044baa81a646271923440b1d95b8251e5041","title":"Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Detection from 3D Brain MRI Data Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","paperAbstract":"As reported by the the Alzheimer's Association, there are more than 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer's today, with an anticipated 16 million by 2050. The neurodegenerative disease is currently the 6th leading source of death in the US. In 2017 this disease would cost the nation $1.1 trillion. 1 in 3 seniors die in Alzheimer's disease or another dementia. It kills more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. [14] As of the this papers writing, detecting Alzheimer's is a difficult and time consuming task, but requires brain imaging report and human expertise. Needless to say, this conventional approach to detect Alzheimer's is costly and often error prone. In this paper an alternative approach has been discussed, that is fast, costs less and more reliable. Deep Learning represents the true bleeding edge of Machine Intelligence. Convolutional Neural Networks are biologically inspired Multilayer perceptron specially capable of image processing. In this paper we present a state of the art Deep Convolutional Neural Network to detect Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia from 3D MRI image.","authors":[{"name":"H. M.

Take precision medicine of cancer as an example, in which the goal is to match patients with treatments based on molecular markers identified in each patient's tumor. A substantial challenge, however, is that the molecular markers can vary significantly at different spatial locations of a tumor. If this spatial distribution could be predicted, the precision of cancer treatment could be greatly improved by adapting treatment to the spatial molecular heterogeneity. This is a challenging task because no technology is available to measure the molecular markers at each spatial location within a tumor. Biopsy samples provide direct measurement, but they are scarce/local. Imaging, such as MRI, is global, but it only provides proxy/indirect measurement. Also available are mechanistic models or domain knowledge, which are often approximate or incomplete. This article proposes a novel machine learning framework to fuse the three sources of data/information to generate a spatial prediction, namely, the knowledge-infused global-local (KGL) data fusion model. A novel mathematical formulation is proposed and solved with theoretical study. We present a real-data application of predicting the spatial distribution of tumor cell density (TCD)--an important molecular marker for brain cancer. A total of 82 biopsy samples were acquired from 18 patients with glioblastoma, together with six MRI contrast images from each patient and biological knowledge encoded by a PDE simulator-based mechanistic model called proliferation-invasion (PI). KGL achieved the highest prediction accuracy and minimum prediction uncertainty compared with a variety of competing methods.

One of the major advantages enjoyed by LITT is its compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowing for high resolution in vivo imaging to be used in LITT procedures. Since laser ablation for pain management is currently exploratory and is only performed at a few centers worldwide, its short-, and long-term effects on the cingulum are currently unknown. Traditionally treatment effects are evaluated by monitoring changes in volume of the ablation zone post-treatment. However, this is sub-optimal since it involves evaluating a single global parameter (volume) to detect changes pre-, and post-MRI. Additionally, the qualitative observations of LITT-related changes on multi-parametric MRI (MPMRI) do not specifically address differentiation between the appearance of treatment related changes (edema, necrosis) from recurrence of the disease (pain recurrence). In this work, we explore the utility of computer extracted texture descriptors on MP-MRI to capture early treatment related changes on a per-voxel basis by extracting quantitative relationships that may allow for an in-depth understanding of tissue response to LITT on MRI, subtle changes that may not be appreciable on original MR intensities. The second objective of this work is to investigate the efficacy of different MRI protocols in accurately capturing treatment related changes within and outside the ablation zone post-LITT. A retrospective cohort of studies comprising pre- and 24-hour post-LITT 3 Tesla T1-weighted (T1w), T2w, T2-GRE, and T2-FLAIR acquisitions was considered. Our scheme involved (1) inter-protocol as well as inter-acquisition affine registration of pre- and post-LITT MRI, (2) quantitation of MRI parameters by correcting for intensity drift in order to examine tissue-specific response, and (3) quantification of MRI maps via texture and intensity features to evaluate changes in MR markers pre- and post-LITT. A total of 78 texture features comprising of non-steerable and steerable gradient and second order statistical features were extracted from pre- and post-LITT MP-MRI on a per-voxel basis. Quantitative, voxel-wise comparison of the changes in MRI texture features between pre-, and post-LITT MRI indicate that (a) steerable and non-steerable gradient texture features were highly sensitive as well as specific in predicting subtle micro-architectural changes within and around the ablation zone pre- and post-LITT, (b) FLAIR was identified as the most sensitive MRI protocol in identifying early treatment changes yielding a normalized percentage change of 360% within the ablation zone relative to its pre-LITT value, and (c) GRE was identified as the most sensitive MRI protocol in quantifying changes outside the ablation zone post-LITT. Our preliminary results thus indicate great potential for non-invasive computerized MRI features in determining localized micro-architectural focal treatment related changes post-LITT.","authors":[{"name":"Pallavi  Tiwari","ids":["2344884"]},{"name":"Shabbar  Danish","ids":["3239367"]},{"name":"Anant  Madabhushi","ids":["1705442"]}],"inCitations":["492d1d8e9fd7a4188f132987614de3aa36bec190","d4710678b440b2097f9de742e083eb91f306aa18","0c5bd5fcd7a18dee8125fdcd07ae561227a7f46e","f8fc096fc1d57f2eda3860dc16cddb8f1363c006","2edc5b78539383726eae11b8bde4f95a740259d8"],"outCitations":["cebd3749ffff4c031e25057bf55469208f52da86","9135d07c5dbd36d919f69da3bf02c2bda2774b71","d72d10c5000ed8f029648180eebc2c07bf64e4e8","1fdb62555eb650662dbe2a6f3985d390861597c2","1398b0ad75598ff1add41dc6f6a1a23abce572cc","1e8628840d05bfb28e7b794d70dae6a08e3d6c2e","3b9f55666e48bca4611775c865e2ab6a971fd5e8","639ee4bb8d748364fa12c44a29cb38e925488ada","dfa3bed97e962755619099db800ad13821e7aebb","b0dad7eb9c15cb225eb849f67bc58efa6d8d2296","211cdecda857b61909368f4a285a7c10d0cb2406","ebb70210eb5d71b31606a0a63031c6b0da87cb36","c6668f512865d27b03a242fd8b4f787e8a5933c4","5d17baf0be1e517cb3493cd8e005655e499cee3c","f8e4af669b62f01e0b28190ed3dcc4aaab2c27dd","e7e245cf1e9508b82138f2b406f14cc7ca7884ea","cd482cfb4b3d202ad4106688c9abcc3d00247c76","10acf358f241c34b15c1778d515e188ca9b797dc","bf4a093d56cb5a3f2d999e3c57722c089e7cfaaa","8e18d703376cfa24cb199e8efd9e7c10094999ca","2b9909394000f0b52914fd260d55850c9464426e","3f5cd14f5d5692622f598a47991572b99161cbba","8bb91a58abc8c5660065de92232e6be65739cb62","bccecc2ccfc6ddc0cb8442ad921a101dd2a2d309","6d712089fe114b9085f17a0fa7b7a04092fbb9b2","5d80cd79523b23129b11da3545946506af084226","7062a6e30aa13a9dbe58aa5ce856f1a67134982e"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8c803c294fa853fbd6786d57210e01197399dd63","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://engineering.case.edu/centers/ccipd/sites/ccipd.case.edu/files/Identifying_MRI_markers_to_evaluate_early.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33954963"],"venue":"Medical Imaging","journalName":"","journalVolume":"9036","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1117/12.2043729","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2043729","pmid":"25075271","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Computer Science","Engineering"],"magId":"2764998787","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"05f21193fbe1f94ffe1ad17885ebcde877f3cff0","title":"Towards annotation-efficient segmentation via image-to-image translation","paperAbstract":"Often in medical imaging, it is prohibitively challenging to produce enough boundary annotations to train deep neural networks for accurate tumor segmentation. We propose the use of weak labels about whether an image presents tumor or whether it is absent to extend training over images that lack these annotations. Specifically, we propose a semi-supervised framework that employs unpaired image-to-image translation between two domains, presence vs. absence of cancer, as the unsupervised objective. We conjecture that translation helps segmentation—both require the target to be separated from the background. We encode images into two codes: one that is common to both domains and one that is unique to the presence domain. Decoding from the common code yields healthy images; decoding with the addition of the unique code produces a residual change to this image that adds cancer. Translation proceeds from presence to absence and vice versa. In the first case, the tumor is readded to the image and we successfully exploit the residual decoder to also perform segmentation. In the second case, unique codes are sampled, producing a distribution of possible tumors. To validate the method, we created challenging synthetic tasks and tumor segmentation datasets from public BRATS (brain, MRI) and LitS (liver, CT) datasets. We show a clear improvement (0.83 Dice on brain, 0.74 on liver) over baseline semi-supervised training with autoencoding (0.73, 0.66) and a mean teacher approach (0.75, 0.69), demonstrating the ability to generalize from smaller distributions of annotated samples.","authors":[{"name":"Eugene  Vorontsov","ids":["37627814"]},{"name":"Pavlo  Molchanov","ids":["2824500"]},{"name":"Christopher  Beckham","ids":["12757989"]},{"name":"Jan  Kautz","ids":["1690538"]},{"name":"Samuel  Kadoury","ids":["1781469"]}],"inCitations":["b19a9f6de6a1f55237950513fad05a87d7efb320"],"outCitations":["372bf2716c53e353be6c3f027493f1a40edb6640","8481290c7406d755a04c846ad7ae105151ba3240","4d6f4b0bbe909821612e5e5bfeff207338053f33","b69badabc3fddc9710faa44c530473397303b0b9","8b6b0c1139a3ab405e6df58aaa79305867f453ef","a1da80cca297f7f47a36dd2d68a3f16cbd1f6c36","83d83640b4c3eb2cbd2b857e17de8e5f9f1ef476","85528a2321cc46018df8c7a16ccf7465bf221414","d0eeab8fcf819261d1b95c60fd48ee9c7d242d7f","dd6d044696df5e4353ff7c92b8009e1201c85129","f0a0c0f0d6a7ff53abea40a8c0c678ed570bf851","2d81914c1855f2d2873fd5cc26897330b42c0472","1201ae8a7576bcc04f0930a03bdd03dcb3ee2e32","b2662b3dd67415f75722e128a62a527c6ceae396","60104351ac65115503c9e92e856bcab6a13b0ce8","c42faad6f2ab45bb3a1cf27408cae32f575632b6","a3ff98389ebcbc26257b71b9f7b51382b45caff4","52c8549a5e517378b380967382ba57a4231a7117","22aab110058ebbd198edb1f1e7b4f69fb13c0613","7f167d10e6fb57f4aa95fb7099a76ba9b5671025","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","452164739ff41f6a849ac7dd26d35934e494fdba","3d5d9d8e74b215609eabba80ef79a35ebf460e49","9e5be29ff2d6bf97607c31ab298590e75812143c","f4e0e970a52742ba9c9f8f8d978f0f95fd56249f","6f965b0f446b8b3ceabad2de46aedbaaeb2a1692","eb60fe884c53b420edbce57059b242cfcbae0f7c","e163a2e89c136cb4442e34c72f7173a0ff46dc79","3e64e2ad412b091900a2c497df106e37c1efa59d","fa50c6a155c75f6a35c3dc3c3a78178e26ce10e0","31922cc3e28f112c943e14f7a13fcdad04679e7b","0655dcaa39cf41a3609974840f91300d73b4aed1","d6f2f611da110b5b5061731be3fc4c7f45d8ee23","367f2c63a6f6a10b3b64b8729d601e69337ee3cc","eccbc278986057b5f1ea1bce9bdcc833712336d6","302207c149bdf7beb6e46e4d4afbd2fa9ac02c64","fe87ea16d5eb1c7509da9a0314bbf4c7b0676506","97fb4e3d45bb098e27e0071448b6152217bd35a5","010e228e969ef470a9852629c2c8ed97afb478c1","4d376d6978dad0374edfa6709c9556b42d3594d3","8c958fe2da5826afad975bfebec0da1953a8b8cc","b36a5bb1707bb9c70025294b3a310138aae8327a","2530cfc7764bda1330c48c0c8e2cd0e0c671d7e1","a8f3dc53e321fbb2565f5925def4365b9f68d1af","eef2024050385085dfc4ed3436b0f5b8beb04a81","63de0ad39d807f0c256f851428f211e8d5fcd3bb","84de7d27e2f6160f634a483e8548c499a2cda7fa","0597aba86088282423e7c2d2deb6fca4075e7a91","37a18be8c599b781cc28b6a62d8f11e8a6a75169","d940489e311a18b438ab00604c178f823d1e9c5a","50004c086ffd6a201a4b782281aaa930fbfe6ecf"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/05f21193fbe1f94ffe1ad17885ebcde877f3cff0","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01636v4.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"e60a07523b3fe85b2fdfd82ebc353f1b415389ff","title":"Multi-scale Nanoparticle Contrast Agents","paperAbstract":"Nanoparticles have potential biomedical applications because of their special physical properties. Multi-scale nanoparticles contrast agents are those particles that provide contrast in different scale imaging modalities. Such particles are of great interest for monitoring anti-cancer drug delivery, allowing investigations of whole body drug distribution as well as that at the microscopic level. Magnetic nanoparticles in particular have been used as contrast agents in MRI and optical techniques such as confocal microscopy and two photon fluorescence (TPF) microscopy to achieve multiple scale imaging. However, confocal microscopy has a limited optical penetration in biological tissue. Moreover, both techniques, confocal microscopy and TPF microscopy, require labelling of the biological tissue which alters the particle distribution and complicates the biological system under-investigation. Coherent Raman scattering (CRS) imaging techniques are label-free with chemical contrast and relatively large optical penetration. To the best of the authors knowledge, only one study was carried out to image magnetic particles with such an imaging system using a four wave mixing (FWM) process. However, micro-sized particles were used and such size is not typical for drug delivery applications. The aim of this thesis is to develop techniques to combine the two scales imaging modalities, MRI and CRS in order to image the well-established MRI contrast agents, iron oxide and gadolinium oxide nanoparticles in a biological context. Moreover, the thesis examines the label-free ability of MRI and CRS to determine tumour boundaries through ex-vivo imaging of a mouse brain tumour. In MRI, it was found that the optimal contrast between healthy tissue and tumour for formalin fixed mouse brain is achieved when a spin echo (SE) sequence with TE/TR = 3000/110 ms is applied. The tumour edges were extracted at high resolution (0.125 × 0.125 × 0.150 mm) which allows measuring the tumour volume in a clinically available 1.5 T MRI scanner with such resolution for the first time. The high resolution labelfree volumetry data was used as a gold standard to estimate experimental error in conventional histology tumour volume measurements and it was found that 20 % average error results from tumour shape irregularity. A mosaic CARS image of a tumour slice was produced with a novel technique that compensates for phase curvature. The magnetic nanparticles were synthesised with homogeneous precipitation and hydrothermal methods and a tuneable mono-disperse sizes were achieved. It was found that the Er doped gadolinium oxide nanoparticles pose a strong upconversion when excited with a 816 nm laser. Doped gadolinium oxide nanoparticles were imaged in CRS system with four wave mixing (FWM) and UC photoluminescence in a biological model. Also, Iron oxide nanoparticles were imaged using FWM and two photon photothermal lensing (TPPL). It can be concluded that MRI and CRS are capable of determining tumour edges in a label-free manner. Moreover, CRS system can be utilised to image nanoparticles contrast agents in a biological tissue with a number of potential optical techniques.","authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Obaid M.

Therefore, the proposed paper presents a framework that introduces a series of simple and computationally cost-effective techniques that have assisted in leveraging the accuracy level to a very higher degree. The proposed framework takes the input image and subjects it to non-conventional segmentation mechanism followed by optimizing the performance using directed acyclic graph, Bayesian Network, and neural network.

The pipeline leverages the fact that MAP-MRI is a generalization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and combines simple and robust processing steps from existing tensor-based image registration methods. First, we compute a DTI study template which provides the reference frame and scaling parameters needed to construct a standardized set of MAP-MRI basis functions at each voxel in template space. Next, we transform each subjects diffusion data, including diffusion weighted images (DWIs) and gradient directions, from native to template space using the corresponding tensor-based deformation fields. Finally, we fit MAP coefficients in template space to the transformed DWIs of each subject using the standardized template of MAP basis functions. The consistency of MAP basis functions across all data sets in template space allows us to: 1. compute a template of propagators by directly averaging MAP coefficients and 2. quantify voxelwise differences between co-registered propagators using the angular dissimilarity, or a probability distance metric, such as the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. We illustrate the application of this method by generating a template of MAP propagators for a cohort of healthy volunteers and show a proof-of-principle example of how this pipeline may be used to detect subtle differences between propagators in a single-subject longitudinal clinical data set. The ability to standardize and analyze multiple clinical MAP-MRI data sets could improve assessments in cross-sectional and single-subject longitudinal clinical studies seeking to detect subtle microstructural changes, such as those occurring in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or during the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, or cancer.","authors":[{"name":"Alexandru V.

The rapid development in the 80s of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and in vivo Spectroscopy (MRS) certainly represented one of the most fascinating examples of integration on basic and applied research in biomedicine. Clinical instrumentation is now widely available, providing high quality three dimensional mapping of anatomy and physiology, performing an invaluable role in the study and evaluation of disease. Despite this widespread application and routine use, the pace of developments in MR have not yet plateaued. Technological advances continue, providing greater speed and the opportunity to perform a wider range of studies in a given individual. The functional role of MR is rapidly developing, accompanied by advances in metabolic mapping and measurement techniques using MRS. In the long term, combination of these techniques in a single examination will allow local anatomy to be precisely identified by MRI, functional properties of organs such as heart, measurement of perfusion, and brain function studies to be performed, together with direct measurement of tissue metabolism providing information on metabolic changes causing, or resulting from, functional defects. This special issue comprises five papers (three on MRI and two on MRS) providing examples of the range of applications and illustrating important developments in clinical applications. Quantification is an essential requirement in clinical MRS and functional MRI. Both methodologies require improved quantification of the physical parameters affecting image contrast and characterizing spectral changes.

Examples of anatomical medical images (AMI) are Computer Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), X-ray radiographs and ultrasound etc. whereas Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) and fMRI are examples of functional medical images (FMI). Irrespective of such types (AMI or FMI), every case can be considered as a medical imaging modality. All these modalities are widely used by clinicians to study the structure/functionality of human body parts for diagnosis and treatment. It is frequently required to combine PET/SPECT with CT/MRI to simultaneous study the metabolic and molecular information received through PET/SPECT with fine anatomical details observed by CT/MRI. This concurrent study will help in the diagnosis and localization of many diseases like cancer, blockage in coronary arteries and brain-related diseases like Parkinson, Alzheimer etc. Further, in many cases, clinicians are required to co-register one or more anatomical images with functional images, for example, ultrasound-guided biopsy fused with PET and MRI. This registration can be done either at the hardware level or at the software level. The introduction of integrated PET-CT machine increases the acceptability of hardware-based registration systems as compared to software-based methods among the medics. One possible reason for this is the lack of validation of results achieved through software-based registration methods. On the other hand, software-based registration methods also have many advantages over the hardware-based registration systems like lesser exposure to radiation and no need for new investment on hardware etc. In this paper, both the methods with their merits and demerits are discussed in detail.","authors":[{"name":"Sandesh  Gupta","ids":["2118973098"]},{"name":"Phalguni  Gupta","ids":["2122334494"]},{"name":"Vivek S.

Intensity values are not only highly dependent on acquisition parameters, but also on the subject and body region being scanned. This warrants the need for image normalization techniques to ensure that intensity values are consistent within tissues across different subjects and visits. Many intensity normalization methods have been developed and proven successful for the analysis of brain pathologies, but evaluation of these methods for images of the prostate region is lagging. In this paper, we compare four different normalization methods on 49 T2-w scans of prostate cancer patients: 1) the well-established histogram normalization, 2) the generalized scale normalization, 3) an extension of generalized scale normalization called generalized ball-scale normalization, and 4) a custom normalization based on healthy prostate tissue intensities. The methods are compared qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of behaviors of intensity distributions as well as impact on radiomic features. Our findings suggest that normalization based on prior knowledge of the healthy prostate tissue intensities may be the most effective way of acquiring the desired properties of normalized images. In addition, the histogram normalization method outperform the generalized scale and generalized ball-scale methods which have proven superior for other body regions.","authors":[{"name":"Lars J Isaksson","ids":["1500682272"]},{"name":"Sara  Raimondi","ids":["49160901"]},{"name":"Francesca  Botta","ids":["33748430"]},{"name":"Matteo  Pepa","ids":["1500677692"]},{"name":"Simone G Gugliandolo","ids":["1500677297"]},{"name":"Simone P De Angelis","ids":["1500681556"]},{"name":"Giulia  Marvaso","ids":["3604404"]},{"name":"Giuseppe  Petralia","ids":["1855293"]},{"name":"Ottavio  De Cobelli","ids":["78079526"]},{"name":"Sara  Gandini","ids":["145463217"]},{"name":"Marta  Cremonesi","ids":["34950489"]},{"name":"Federica  Cattani","ids":["2567995"]},{"name":"Paul  Summers","ids":["2689154"]},{"name":"Barbara A Jereczek-Fossa","ids":["2064411751"]}],"inCitations":["62b2c66b5caab6e37317bd6c6689fbd73afe92e5","62bca5c638ca13f456e89aa526183e8194aa81d3","5a59d2d3bb9adc8d7f8f6f72d68cd8b475a0d2d8","0258fe7be3fc6f9b2b31e6286bdc06d3673a9c78","b016d611eadc0d395aa21e2ac5ee0d211c8c5808","e2c2ae2c7d9104643c4d622a71a684ea1ffd8fdb","24f818e49a3855a93e5dcef40e64eb26387ca716","d2d970fee531866908bebd355761eae68daaa724","92d25e962ce4dbc921affb2aebf8f3c0e9e1f9b3","fd59188bf2e7af1ae010a049f281756b03f0717f"],"outCitations":["dd7ceee5b05eb672e850140220f7db44ead3968f","a3690b8489d6afdf5753b97f1940bfd0a24969e6","938a013842b3ebcf2c09f13eb4b7dbe17e3f5d37","e7e245cf1e9508b82138f2b406f14cc7ca7884ea","f58795bc8b962c0d35cadca2866ee7ea43049a71","16329934abcdbd46e5b0f7c201799c7d8a6d28c4","10acf358f241c34b15c1778d515e188ca9b797dc","14fe69ba910e7719edd1b682c724ee1002a55964","b5bb6b75e940809fd48bb28c8af1f387c03cc7e7","b80925eccdd729f66423305c1b57904bd11d6ceb","fcffea9b85406da79b57b49a92eb5a524d24f445","08833256b5ead27690b2266afbc57be70d30e78d","6066d64c65fcf04ee004cb036c2f3c7bb34bbfe6","cbb8725245a09455b62ff6a649956e77c62cd89e","0cc3b67b20a1065a9d75811df65c06bfb44a5bec","dbe23ea6edaa9ea305aafca3df8021100978c4fa","776554b9b57bb1d1fafa00ed30f16b6f3c04b2f0","422bdddb34b4ed581591381de4c7cd6445d25a22","2ff630beab85e6a3c43186fefea81eca7251334a","a6133261507af708881817166842d62b67ddff36","50fcaedfb92b866f7ebe15b9ffc093a34de8f23d","806fd75c68cdc973b5650b34a441f297e86a72b6","d7f7a1b85edcae6d3ee326a33a29a9fd738f96a6","c322ec6c75bbf76512c0117e01bf9b34d2a1f5de","27244a3c55084af4aa33d7a41b6eac202a59b7b6","397a07074735d3534a1ce379353d5891a9e95d08","744657fe1d563feeeaf124347b032d71cf2c4522","1b8b383aa6e3998aacdd9aa1b3f2cb9cfc231c26"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1e7491672a51082dd1db56bf7c011468bb0bbad","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics","journalName":"Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics","journalVolume":"71","journalPages":"\n          7-13\n        ","doi":"10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.02.007","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.02.007","pmid":"32086149","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"3007375197","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"fe3eec3990fafc225377744acf85d5c9b28e39ea","title":"Radiogenomics model for overall survival prediction of glioblastoma","paperAbstract":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive and infiltrative brain tumor with a high mortality rate. There are radiomic models with handcrafted features to estimate glioblastoma prognosis. In this work, we evaluate to what extent of combining genomic with radiomic features makes an impact on the prognosis of overall survival (OS) in patients with GBM. We apply a hypercolumn-based convolutional network to segment tumor regions from magnetic resonance images (MRI), extract radiomic features (geometric, shape, histogram), and fuse with gene expression profiling data to predict survival rate for each patient. Several state-of-the-art regression models such as linear regression, support vector machine, and neural network are exploited to conduct prognosis analysis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of MRI and gene expression profiling is used in the study to observe the model performance in radiomic, genomic, and radiogenomic features. The results demonstrate that genomic data are correlated with the GBM OS prediction, and the radiogenomic model outperforms both radiomic and genomic models. We further illustrate the most significant genes, such as IL1B, KLHL4, ATP1A2, IQGAP2, and TMSL8, which contribute highly to prognosis analysis. Graphical Abstract Our Proposed fully automated \"Radiogenomic\"\" approach for survival prediction overview. It fuses geometric, intensity, volumetric, genomic and clinical information to predict OS.","authors":[{"name":"Navodini  Wijethilake","ids":["1705086796"]},{"name":"Mobarakol  Islam","ids":["145481136"]},{"name":"Hongliang  Ren","ids":["1738214662"]}],"inCitations":["891bcb60681e4a40ae014cd9a4410c9a1528bbc5","3dda4d38676d93b632e4457a37c10cb2c44a7211","d2d8fa1a19a55a0ff880ca9c80e3e4dc814c3d8b","417647034b7228818dd96e913a45b05fecc77fa2","96db8bdb396d709738b02b7845b949054e9ba9b8","178192a745c522e566ac2e93cf03e2ae59c7b809","58f8f30ab4e43dc23be47e9d1bfd99b620cf9e5f","79b4cfb3c456e3479c3611184c5d758596d3e8c0"],"outCitations":["b36a5bb1707bb9c70025294b3a310138aae8327a","eb42cf88027de515750f230b23b1a057dc782108","c83c72d26ca8d4152150f1ccbbb180542662cdfa","4eacd59b8e1255656f21496f9704ec15635acb9e","ef0c2e7fb8d92febcdd77e105f1f97e8526140fb","fb6b4b57f431a0cfbb83bb2af8beab4ee694e94c","ec3472acc24fe5ef9eb07a31697f2cd446c8facc","a2f7e696210f300c985fa2b75e4a0a5c5a08bdb1","7fc464470b441c691d10e7331b14a525bc79b8bb","5089be2817b9979237fb091fc8ebaae88154dbc0","188186e08f5dff92de2afe8fcd3dd1acee936ccb","a53a460aa1fd81b492452460f6954b30d447aad3","52905f0f471ab4a59e3918af69a676ef838df941","9046f54b52b0fea8b99609c6bb08696d4a3583a2","b63b07925a4fd3a24194336b4fda5f5bf81a6aab","9971ff92d9d09b4736228bdbd7726e2e19b9aa2d","f9c45a1beb146cd681ca822f587df88b03f64d01","742a6239c72ef72aad6d5e1364a3dbfea8c25e2c","36e2d83122bbb27fa16cb1c0d4dd6e509d10623b","01a5df9993206455cb425782571ebd8fe4dcc3b5","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","b9e9e13cda97114004a064258827364d7ee4a1e2","f494b38f64d1566b4d6fec5f8dc4fb8509c66932","edb4a592d7b66bfa476c097c3e80bd8f6e56ed0a","acb3fcea6ad8cdbea541798f97e6a0294b7ebccb","41ceb659e21edd9b64d3a58caa81c880b8537a22","9585eed348e7a49ceb063fe0391a5ca65ff71fcc","13b0d41514ea0d6a67657bea947cc02959b1a872","317aee7fc081f2b137a85c4f20129007fd8e717e","168f28ac3c8c7ea63bf7ed25f2288e8b67e2fe74","ca950e7cfa105817b096d6029ec949b92916a073","04192bd8eb27b6ba63b792e43edf73dc02cb0e1d","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","ac793a22a276e670c13991dd7c1a67f7868e4f5b","6f7ef8ed60553b37bdf335876ac4e0adf400d1a8","c3e978a210edae835fcc01e84d9d44349cd9992f","50c6b6e6576850a26062e090ad7ff0e607d13703","48d56083c966cdb50e36797bfae60973e05254e2","2d32d7ff3eccc27f0373a36e9de57f56a5dfc9a6","b353aabccdca7f02db48d4669038972108cedc2f","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","72d612233a341ef6126b71957b4697fc0bb1acbe"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fe3eec3990fafc225377744acf85d5c9b28e39ea","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96128983"],"venue":"Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing","journalName":"Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing","journalVolume":"58","journalPages":"1767-1777","doi":"10.1007/s11517-020-02179-9","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11517-020-02179-9","pmid":"32488372","fieldsOfStudy":["Biology","Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"3029143226","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"33a53f839f7679830088871e0ec9c75f03a651fa","title":"Practical applications of machine learning in imaging trials","paperAbstract":"Machine learning and deep learning are ubiquitous across a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including medical imaging. An overview of multiple application areas along the imaging chain where deep learning methods are utilized in discovery and clinical quantitative imaging trials is presented. Example application areas along the imaging chain include quality control, preprocessing, segmentation, and scoring. Within each area, one or more specific applications is demonstrated, such as automated structural brain MRI quality control assessment in a core lab environment, super-resolution MRI preprocessing for neurodegenerative disease quantification in translational clinical trials, and multimodal PET/CT tumor segmentation in prostate cancer trials. The quantitative output of these algorithms is described, including their impact on decision making and relationship to traditional read-based methods. Development and deployment of these techniques for use in quantitative imaging trials presents unique challenges. The interplay between technical and scientific domain knowledge required for algorithm development is highlighted. The infrastructure surrounding algorithm deployment is critical, given regulatory, method robustness, computational, and performance considerations. The sensitivity of a given technique to these considerations and thus complexity of deployment is task- and phase-dependent. Context is provided for the infrastructure surrounding these methods, including common strategies for data flow, storage, access, and dissemination as well as application-specific considerations for individual use cases.","authors":[{"name":"Jacob Y.

The aim of microstructure imaging is to provide information related to cellular structure from non-invasive imaging modali¬ties, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This can be achieved by developing accurate tissue models and relating them to imaging data. Diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) measures the displacement of the water molecules inside the tissue which is sensitive to the configuration of cellular membranes, therefore it provides relevant information for characterizing tissue microstructure. \nThis PhD thesis presents my work on developing novel DW-MRI sequences and tissue models which provide improved sensitivity to cellular features such as pore size and shape. To model the DW-MRI signal, the tissue is regarded as a porous medium with cells described as fluid-filled pores separated by impermeable membranes. The first part of this thesis is concentrated on improving the estimation of intrinsic diffu¬sivity and pore size. Specifically, it analyses a promising class of diffusion sequences, namely oscillating gradients, which measure diffusion on a short time scale and give access to small structures, such as cell nuclei. Additionally, it emphasises the benefits of low-frequency oscillating waveforms over the standard acquisition for estimating axon diameter. \nThe second part of my project focuses on estimating complex tissue features such as pore elongation and size distribution, and it demonstrates that these features are in¬trinsically linked and need to be explicitly modelled for accurate results. Moreover, it shows that pulse sequences with varying gradient orientation, such as double diffusion encoding, are able to separate these effects more effectively than standard sequences. The most recent study combines the benefits of both sequences in an innovative acqui¬sition with double oscillating gradients. This supports estimates of cell size distribution and eccentricity for a wider range of substrates.","authors":[{"name":"A.

we present neural network clustering by deterministic annealing as a powerful strategy for self-organized segmentation of biomedical image time-series data identifying groups of pixels sharing common properties of local signal dynamics. After introducing the theoretical concept of minimal free energy vector quantization and related clustering techniques, we discuss its potential to serve as a multi-purpose computer vision strategy to image time-series analysis and visualization for many fields of medicine ranging from biomedical basic research to clinical assessment of patient data. In particular, we present applications to (i) functional MRI data analysis for human brain mapping, (ii) dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease, and (iii) magnetic resonance mammography for the analysis of suspicious lesions in patients with breast cancer. This wide scope of completely different medical applications illustrates the flexibility and conceptual power of neural network vector quantization in this context. Although there are obvious methodological similarities, each application requires specific careful consideration w.r.t. data preprocessing, postprocessing and interpretation. This challenge can only be managed by close interdisciplinary cooperation of medical doctors, engineers, and computer scientists. Hence, this field of research can serve as an example for lively cross-fertilization between computer vision and related research.","authors":[{"name":"Axel  Wismüller","ids":["1864540"]},{"name":"Oliver  Lange","ids":["2040372"]},{"name":"Dominik R.

Trees classifier","paperAbstract":"This paper concerns a new features type of Glioblastoma (GBM) detection based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We address the task of the new features to identify the brain tumor using the T1, T2 weighted and FLAIR MR images. An abnormal area is detected using the multithresholding segmentation with morphological operations of MR images, while discarding those that are either redundant or confusing, thereby improving the performance of the feature-based scheme to detected brain tumor. Decision Tree classifier is applied on GMM features reduced using three principal components to evaluate the performance of cancer and normal area discrimination. The discrimination between GBM and normal area including the images, was compared using three performance indicators, namely, accuracy, false alarm and missed detection, and three modes of MRI images T1, T2 and Flair were employed. The GMM features demonstrated the best performance overall. For the T1 and T2 weighted images, the accuracy performance was 100 % with 0% missed detection and 0% false alarm respectively.

In this work, we present the practical design of a dual-frequency RF surface coil that provides (1)H and (23)Na images of the rat head at 4 T. The dual-frequency RF surface coil comprised of a large loop tuned to the (1)H frequency and a smaller co-planar loop tuned to the (23)Na frequency. The mutual coupling between the two loops was eliminated by the use of a trap circuit inserted in the smaller coil. This independent-loop design was versatile since it enabled a separate optimisation of the sensitivity and RF field distributions of the two coils. To allow for an easy extension of this simple double-tuned coil design to other frequencies (nuclei) and dimensions, we describe in detail the practical aspects of the workbench design and MRI testing using a phantom that mimics in vivo conditions. A comparison between our independent-loop, double-tuned coil and a single-tuned (23)Na coil of equal size obtained with a phantom matching in vivo conditions, showed a reduction of the (23)Na sensitivity (about 28 %) because of signal losses in the trap inductance. Typical congruent (1)H and (23)Na rat brain images showing good SNR ((23)Na: brain 7, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid 11) and spatial resolution ((23)Na: 1.25 x 1.25 x 5mm(3)) are also reported. The in vivo SNR values obtained with this coil were comparable to, if not better than, other contemporary designs in the literature.","authors":[{"name":"M  Alecci","ids":["50307429"]},{"name":"S

from 3D brain tumor MRIs: A robustness analysis points out the need for standardization.","paperAbstract":"Abstract Introduction: Textural analysis refers to a variety of mathematical methods used to quantify the spatial variations in grey levels within images. In brain tumors, textural features have a great potential as imaging biomarkers having been shown to correlate with survival, tumor grade, tumor type, etc. However, these measures should be reproducible under dynamic range and matrix size changes for their clinical use. Our aim is to study this robustness in brain tumors with 3D magnetic resonance imaging, not previously reported in the literature. Materials and methods: 3D T1-weighted images of 20 patients with glioblastoma (64.80 ± 9.12 years-old) obtained from a 3T scanner were analyzed. Tumors were segmented using an in-house semi-automatic 3D procedure. A set of 16 3D textural features of the most common types (co-occurrence and run-length matrices) were selected, providing regional (run-length based measures) and local information (co-ocurrence matrices) on the tumor heterogeneity. Feature robustness was assessed by means of the coefficient of variation (CV) under both dynamic range (16, 32 and 64 gray levels) and/or matrix size (256x256 and 432x432) changes. Results: None of the textural features considered were robust under dynamic range changes. The textural co-occurrence matrix feature Entropy was the only textural feature robust (CV < 10%) under spatial resolution changes. Conclusions: In general, textural measures of three-dimensional brain tumor images are neither robust under dynamic range nor under matrix size changes. Thus, it becomes mandatory to fix standards for image rescaling after acquisition before the textural features are computed if they are to be used as imaging biomarkers. For T1-weighted images a dynamic range of 16 grey levels and a matrix size of 256x256 (and isotropic voxel) is found to provide reliable and comparable results and is feasible with current MRI scanners. The implications of this work go beyond the specific tumor type and MRI sequence studied here and pose the need for standardization in textural feature calculation of oncological images.FUNDING: James S. Mc.

Micro-brachytherapy with radioactive Holmium-166 showed to be an effective palliative care method for primary and metastatic brain tumors and intratumoral administration with holmium microspheres (HoMS) showed very promising results with respect to the amount of treatment sessions, hospitalization stay and side effects. This study evaluates the state-of-the-art of available treatment methods for brain malignancies in order to develop a standardized intratumoral administration device for holmium microspheres, where dosimetry, local distribution and visualization of the microparticles are considered most important. The prototype, designed, manufactured and validated within this study creates a tumor-extracorporeal duct for a non-active steerable inner needle to control spatial intratumoral deposition of the HoMS. Validation of the administration device is done by accuracy tests during incision in gelatin phantoms, fluid flow tests with a HoMS suspension and imaging tests with 1.5T MRI for the quantification of artefacts. The inner needle has a pre-bend tip that can achieve a horizontal and vertical displacement of respectively 13.0 and 15.6 mm with an error kept below 2.0 mm in 3-dimensional space (94%) , depending on target depth, during incision in a homogeneous porcine gelatin phantom mimicking the stiffest tumor tissue found in literature. Adjustments of stylet depth and orientation will allow for deposition of HoMS over a surface of 5.8 cm2 and with the aid of this delivery device tumors normally treated by SRS, considering the size (diameter l 30 mm), can be treated. To localize the needle and the holmium microspheres in the phantom real-time 1.5T MRI is used. The tests within this study show a high accuracy with a visualization error of 0.1 - 1.1 mm for the titanium outer needle and an error of 0.2 - 0.5 mm for the nitinol inner needle, depending on needle angle towards the magnetic field. Future research can be performed with the administration device prototype to define right dosimetry, distribution and volume of the HoMS for effective treatment of specific braintumors.","authors":[{"name":"Martijn de Vries","ids":["112879189"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e2e9884c704bb1dd6d720eb54c19f151b0ab9cb","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"2901788439","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"1f1635073827bc736170b7bead92c50508081d4d","title":"Coupling brain-tumor biophysical models and diffeomorphic image registration.","paperAbstract":"We present SIBIA (Scalable Integrated Biophysics-based Image Analysis), a framework for joint image registration and biophysical inversion and we apply it to analyze MR images of glioblastomas (primary brain tumors). We have two applications in mind. The first one is normal-to-abnormal image registration in the presence of tumor-induced topology differences. The second one is biophysical inversion based on single-time patient data. The underlying optimization problem is highly non-linear and non-convex and has not been solved before with a gradient-based approach. Given the segmentation of a normal brain MRI and the segmentation of a cancer patient MRI, we determine tumor growth parameters and a registration map so that if we \"grow a tumor\" (using our tumor model) in the normal brain and then register it to the patient image, then the registration mismatch is as small as possible. This \"coupled problem\" two-way couples the biophysical inversion and the registration problem. In the image registration step we solve a large-deformation diffeomorphic registration problem parameterized by an Eulerian velocity field. In the biophysical inversion step we estimate parameters in a reaction-diffusion tumor growth model that is formulated as a partial differential equation (PDE). In SIBIA, we couple these two sub-components in an iterative manner. We first presented the components of SIBIA in \"Gholami et al., Framework for Scalable Biophysics-based Image Analysis, IEEE/ACM Proceedings of the SC2017\", in which we derived parallel distributed memory algorithms and software modules for the decoupled registration and biophysical inverse problems. In this paper, our contributions are the introduction of a PDE-constrained optimization formulation of the coupled problem, and the derivation of a Picard iterative solution scheme. We perform extensive tests to experimentally assess the performance of our method on synthetic and clinical datasets. We demonstrate the convergence of the SIBIA optimization solver in different usage scenarios. We demonstrate that using SIBIA, we can accurately solve the coupled problem in three dimensions (2563 resolution) in a few minutes using 11 dual-x86 nodes.","authors":[{"name":"Klaudius

By way of medical imaging modalities patient's life be able to be improved throughout an accurate and rapid remedial without any side effects. The most important reason of this paper is to increased methodology that may accurately classify a tumor growth from abnormal tissues. This examination work has distinguished region growing segmentation Technique and implement and reflect. From our validation test comes about, this examination work uncovered that this model neglects to create useful groups order force effect poor tumor characterization precision. The images used for tumor segmentation are obtained from MRI modality. During this research, we've developed an image segmentation technique based on catchments basins and ridge lines to segment the brain image accurately. This technique relies on interest techniques for extracting tumor portion of the images in the watershed segmentation. Direct application of watershed leads to over-segmentation because of the presence of noise and different irregularities accepted in digital images. Thus to avoid this, we've carried out some preprocessing to eliminate noise present within the MRI images through acquisition stage. Then mask the watershed segmentation. After preprocessing step, we have a tendency to calculate the morphological operation of the input images. This exists one of the real issues to predict the tumor design and to address this issue; the masked watershed Segmentation Technique is proposed and resolute overall Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy. Meningiomas represent 36.4% of all primary brain tumors, creating them the foremost common primary brain tumor. There'll be an estimated 24,880 new cases in 2016.Gliomas, a broad expression which includes all tumors take place from the supportive tissue of the brain, correspond to 27% of the entire brain tumors and 80% of the entire malignant tumors. Glioblastomas represent 15.1% of the entire primary brain tumors and 55.1% of the entire gliomas. Glioblastoma has the maximum number of cases of all malignant tumors, with an estimated 12,120 original cases predicted in 2016. Astrocytomas, as well as glioblastoma, represent just about 75% of all gliomas. Nerve sheath tumors/acoustic neuromas characterize about 8% of all primary brain tumors. Pituitary tumors correspond to 15.5% of the entire primary brain tumors. There resolve to be an estimated 11,700 new cases of pituitary tumors in 2016. Lymphomas stand for 2% of all primary brain tumors. Oligodendrogliomas stand for nearly 2% of all primary brain tumors. Medulloblastomas/primitive tumors represent 1% of all primary brain tumors. The greater part of primary tumors (36.4%) is placed within the meninges. Possible usage for brain tumors differs fairly a bit stand on the size and position of the tumor in the brain, at the same time as the person's overall health and risk factors. Usually, on the other hand, the initial step is the removal of the tumor, generally through some type of surgical procedure. After that, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a mixture of the two treatments is placed to eradicate cancer from neighboring tissue and hopefully prevent its repetition.","authors":[{"name":"C.

However, complete resection of the cancer is hard to achieve due to the invasive nature of these tumors, where the margins of the tumors become blurred from frank tumor to more normal brain tissue, but in which single cells or clusters of malignant cells may have invaded. Recent developments in fluorescence imaging techniques have shown great potential for improved surgical outcomes by providing surgeons intraoperative contrast-enhanced visual information of tumor in neurosurgery. The current near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores, such as indocyanine green (ICG), cyanine5.5 (Cy5.5), 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), are showing clinical potential to be useful in targeting and guiding resections of such tumors. Real-time tumor margin identification in NIR imaging could be helpful to both surgeons and patients by reducing the operation time and space required by other imaging modalities such as intraoperative MRI, and has the potential to integrate with robotically assisted surgery. In this paper, a segmentation method based on the Chan-Vese model was developed for identifying the tumor boundaries in an ex-vivo mouse brain from relatively noisy fluorescence images acquired by a multimodal scanning fiber endoscope (mmSFE). Tumor contours were achieved iteratively by minimizing an energy function formed by a level set function and the segmentation model. Quantitative segmentation metrics based on tumor-to-background (T/B) ratio were evaluated. Results demonstrated feasibility in detecting the brain tumor margins at quasi-real-time and has the potential to yield improved precision brain tumor resection techniques or even robotic interventions in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Danying  Hu","ids":["2282203"]},{"name":"Yang  Jiang","ids":["1992688147"]},{"name":"Evgenii  Belykh","ids":["47016266"]},{"name":"Yuanzheng  Gong","ids":["2729614"]},{"name":"Mark C.

In particular, first results of the Intra Voxel Analysis (IVA) technique are reported. The idea is to exploit CS peculiarities in order to distinguish different contributions inside the same resolution cell, instead of reconstructing images from not fully sampled k-space acquisition. Applied to MRI field, this means the possibility of estimating the presence of different tissues inside the same voxel, i.e. in one pixel of the obtained image. In other words, the method is the first attempt, as far as we know, of achieving Spectroscopy-like results starting from each pixel of MR images. In particular, tissues are distinguished each others by evaluating their spin-spin relaxation times. Within this manuscript, first results on clinical dataset, in particular a phantom made by aqueous solution and oil and an occipital brain lesion corresponding to a metastatic breast cancer nodule, are reported. Considering the phantom dataset, in particular focusing on the slice where the separation between water and oil occurs, the methodology is able to distinguish the two components with different spin-spin relaxation times. With respect to clinical dataset,focusing on a voxel of the lesion area, the approach is able to detect the presence of two tissues, namely the healthy and the cancer related ones, while in other location outside the lesion only the healthy tissue is detected. Of course, these are the first results of the proposed methodology, further studies on different types of clinical datasets are required in order to widely validate the approach. Although few datasets have been considered, results seem both interesting and promising.","authors":[{"name":"Michele  Ambrosanio","ids":["1855079"]},{"name":"Fabio  Baselice","ids":["2808974"]},{"name":"Giampaolo  Ferraioli","ids":["2416448"]},{"name":"Vito  Pascazio","ids":["2094430"]}],"inCitations":["9a926065deda41edf57a550adb4c8c134905547f"],"outCitations":["e10dc35413a3f90ab15580d2cf640c8727f0bc8f","11b540a21bff601f3b055acbbddb170454d951d8","f3db2e9a0cdfa485160e7bdc93e032f35b069c4d","506990305a80381fb7195b25a43d5735db48dd8e","0007d514a56dc3f58127d7dd9420a5663a8e76af","2e656cf982f968133b8625b43b0b06404c1793fb","a4135287b194a6b12ef509544ca0500b75085d55","31375dc749d5905ffd1009ee39c2cdbb4527403e","95037f742b759067d456fe798b1cf4d8e829bb35"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/afdf4494f456272347bb2db2bdb537ad7f217a8a","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2043031"],"venue":"Medical Imaging","journalName":"","journalVolume":"9034","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1117/12.2043031","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2043031","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Engineering","Physics","Computer Science"],"magId":"2010112016","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"6985dd8548b019ab3559aeb04a1b5f017cae4310","title":"Automated detection and quantification of residual brain tumor using an interactive computer-aided detection scheme","paperAbstract":"Detection of residual brain tumor is important to evaluate efficacy of brain cancer surgery, determine optimal strategy of further radiation therapy if needed, and assess ultimate prognosis of the patients. Brain MR is a commonly used imaging modality for this task. In order to distinguish between residual tumor and surgery induced scar tissues, two sets of MRI scans are conducted pre- and post-gadolinium contrast injection. The residual tumors are only enhanced in the post-contrast injection images. However, subjective reading and quantifying this type of brain MR images faces difficulty in detecting real residual tumor regions and measuring total volume of the residual tumor. In order to help solve this clinical difficulty, we developed and tested a new interactive computer-aided detection scheme, which consists of three consecutive image processing steps namely, 1) segmentation of the intracranial region, 2) image registration and subtraction, 3) tumor segmentation and refinement. The scheme also includes a specially designed and implemented graphical user interface (GUI) platform. When using this scheme, two sets of pre- and post-contrast injection images are first automatically processed to detect and quantify residual tumor volume. Then, a user can visually examine segmentation results and conveniently guide the scheme to correct any detection or segmentation errors if needed. The scheme has been repeatedly tested using five cases. Due to the observed high performance and robustness of the testing results, the scheme is currently ready for conducting clinical studies and helping clinicians investigate the association between this quantitative image marker and outcome of patients.","authors":[{"name":"Kevin P.

Several imaging modalities have been developed to acquire anatomical and functional information about human body and organs. These modalities differ in basic principles of image acquisition but provide, in most cases, complementary information to define a physiological process. It is important to acquire and analyze all of the information describing the specific anatomical and functional behavior for diagnosis, treatment and therapeutic intervention. It becomes apparent that synergetic multidisciplinary efforts involving researchers from medicine, biological sciences, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering and computer science are needed for further advancement of existing imaging technologies. Such a synergy is also needed to invent new multiparameter imaging technologies to improve understanding and modeling of physiological behavior which could be used for early diagnosis of specific diseases and to devise better methods of treatment, intervention and clinical management. Future trends may include a virtual environment of interactions among researchers and clinicians through global databases and information processing modules involving models, simulations and clinical trials. This talk will present an overview of some advanced medical imaging modalities such as multi-parameter MRI and then present model-based adaptive tissue segmentation methods from brain images for detection and characterization of brain pathologies. Recent research results for analysis of multi-parameter brain MR images involving brain tumor and stroke characterization will be presented. Also, multi-parameter multi-spectral optical imaging for characterizing skin cancer will be presented.

In contrast, there exists a limited amount of methods proposed to date for multiclass brain abnormalities detection. Such detection has shown its importance in biomedical research and has remained a challenging task. Almost all existing methods are designed using conventional machine learning approaches, however, deep learning methods, due to their advantages over machine learning, have recently achieved great success in various computer vision and medical imaging applications. In this paper, a deep neural network termed as stacked random vector functional link (RVFL) based autoencoder (SRVFL-AE) is proposed to detect the multiclass brain abnormalities. The RVFL autoencoders are the basic building blocks of the proposed SRVFL-AE. The main purpose of choosing RVFL as the core component of the proposed SRVFL-AE is to improve the generalization capability and learning speed compared to traditional autoencoder based deep learning methods. Further, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function is incorporated in the proposed deep network to provide fast and better hidden representation of input features. To evaluate the effectiveness of suggested method, two benchmark multiclass MR brain datasets such as MD-1 and MD-2 are considered. The scheme achieved a greater accuracy of 96.67% and 95.00% on MD-1 and MD-2 datasets respectively. The efficacy of the model is also tested over a standard breast cancer dataset. The results demonstrated that our deep network obtains better performance with least training time and compact network architecture compared to its counterparts.","authors":[{"name":"Deepak Ranjan Nayak","ids":["34882165"]},{"name":"Ratnakar  Dash","ids":["8897880"]},{"name":"Banshidhar  Majhi","ids":["1683610"]},{"name":"Ram Bilas Pachori","ids":["2812708"]},{"name":"Yudong  Zhang","ids":["121310035"]}],"inCitations":["2fbb7008579b397ebd351c04a15bcd769a499690","db519a83d9fd372d9a081166e76d3aa1df62c1cd","de39882e752fa2e367d8857e1842b0b68f4c2d89","3672d1ec78f6ccb22a48d51ad40b3fe1e14dedce","c8f4d387e00d24458c1b3660c0644dd796821129","5c107f5aa33e3e5d3b3ea9dc17e04a51765b0983","0d05e201a7b005661b68c119b785beabff9b5572","b377b3e44e3830c454d7b368a807f33886927583","349ab42136c981a1f099971d31b9028cdea22818","09ca6201eee28a67587e3c679ddbeea0ccb8ad3c","1e366a7e8e2d07c835679e12e7150b5d4e581794","01f39c51febd70e6cfae07f9438aea3a8cdcccfe","ee535413be71259e168238d58843264a74acee79"],"outCitations":["5498ef25127ef9d6e5d0fb6f04c63a0529b7e037","eb687fea8afdaf3da40d159a388d67e856febbd3","2abde28f75a9135c8ed7c50ea16b7b9e49da0c09","624ff03e69d6d99466cd50f0abc572c5a947a41d","81e89f25baed869a690ffc6f93cd0306c58efe14","843959ffdccf31c6694d135fad07425924f785b1","43fac30640789e0034a768349ce5699836e6d43d","8cf013fb85984587bd0d32007102e425dd092799","cce66b0c73d4be34c4de07a7f899d3f750863971","c88976a0dbbd72c06d2800d9c5d7a6bfe498ee01","1bcb4c3883342af9dc5c367004232dd64a859378","8f144d777f7d98211e37447a5da0bbfec1cd3273","193edd20cae92c6759c18ce93eeea96afd9528eb","5726c7b40fcc454b77d989656c085520bf6c15fa","d079f2a878ecf0e91b62eb75daa2a2391e2e2ce0","6450acd99255db597f5cf394571190093e28af2d","12bca48fff90ca7a796e480963bc2000048d62f8","e15cf50aa89fee8535703b9f9512fca5bfc43327","c6e170b682077ca6bb5dd2b29957cfb7b556da41","d6f2f611da110b5b5061731be3fc4c7f45d8ee23","70d99665161abfa3db77cce7fb440401f0be1605","46eb79e5eec8a4e2b2f5652b66441e8a4c921c3e","e95d3934e51107da7610acd0b1bcb6551671f9f1","c1d04c9d87ac5d08ce23eac1d38c3215d4827745","2878d9936f494ed7d0c8aec47e9bcc5e51609f9a","03d67da60612e60692b0bfdac1eedadc0a98905d","de10c2806f7c5dce2381435546d95435ea362e37","0f1c399a72332a6af01e4126598f45bd93d2a2d5","fc52373e23093b0a84f9e5b3c860c799999fba2c","21b8c9f77fbaeb7762967993f09e5cf6a404509f","739769f4862753fc80057194456d758d2a148ee3","ee184594c0ce534dd4a1b6ce8fda4f54e33c4363","e60ff004dde5c13ec53087872cfcdd12e85beb57","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","7b97cabe34e1640e3ea8ccd4adf31cbdd24ec5c5","00cd1dab559a9671b692f39f14c1573ab2d1416b","fc5b183fbff8725908445082541c9f1c6131e4d5","06795360de432d2b8087fe038b55746e46315bba","668b1277fbece28c4841eeab1c97e4ebd0079700","54378aef6ec3423ad44d61de61b301be9f5c686d","bd5d67bc40ec7ee6bad6c6ca045028533bf6647c","8e65b09bf17d0b89ee7b60db47cc830f1951b783","331f091d424eb5d57f21c9427928f5a5ca3d9973","ae7b843291de7578bfa798c00bcda4aaa8a28fb4","34472b15fd3382fd11bfbc369b1f66845f5a068d","c5f330ccaa622a60c473dc19223bab45e0674821","7d0322291756391309fb0c3fd49615737f68da61","65ffa98d01eabd725d0797e441f85192159c03df","d70c182a71aea05a145391b24d6bc3cdeede32a5","e9d3f0352e5a5fcf1391adaff5d8bff1074a64b1","1d0635cda34b8af995313848a0c42bac6efe79ec","4f61779a850eff1fe544613a1769f02f0b145441","d4fcf51f3e355c27afe690f60ba3160ef96d5dd5","e2b7f37cd97a7907b1b8a41138721ed06a0b76cd"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c6f49bd57392e16e632415de75e103883320a056","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.101860"],"venue":"Biomed.

Gliomas grading plays an important role to determine the treatment plan and prognosis prediction. In this study we propose two novel methods for automatic, non-invasively distinguishing low-grade (Grades II and III) glioma (LGG) and high-grade (grade IV) glioma (HGG) on conventional MRI images by using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll MRI images have been preprocessed first by rigid image registration and intensity inhomogeneity correction. Both proposed methods consist of two steps: (1) 3D brain tumor segmentation based on a modification of the popular U-Net model; (2) tumor classification on segmented brain tumor. In the first method, the slice with largest area of tumor is determined and the state-of-the-art mask R-CNN model is employed for tumor grading. To improve the performance of the grading model, a 2D data augmentation has been implemented to increase both the amount and the diversity of the training images. In the second method, denoted as 3DConvNet, a 3D volumetric CNNs is applied directly on bounding image regions of segmented tumor for classification, which can fully leverage the 3D spatial contextual information of volumetric image data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe proposed schemes were evaluated on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) low grade glioma (LGG) data, and the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BraTS) Benchmark 2018 training data sets with 5-fold cross validation. All data are divided into training, validation, and test sets. Based on biopsy-proven ground truth, the performance metrics of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are measured on the test sets. The results are 0.935 (sensitivity), 0.972 (specificity), and 0.963 (accuracy) for the 2D Mask R-CNN based method, and 0.947 (sensitivity), 0.968 (specificity), and 0.971 (accuracy) for the 3DConvNet method, respectively. In regard to efficiency, for 3D brain tumor segmentation, the program takes around ten and a half hours for training with 300 epochs on BraTS 2018 data set and takes only around 50 seconds for testing of a typical image with a size of 160x216x176. For 2D Mask R-CNN based tumor grading, the program takes around 4 hours for training with around 60000 iterations, and around 1 second for testing of a 2D slice image with size of 128x128. For 3DConvNet based tumor grading, the program takes around 2 hours for training with 10000 iterations, and 0.25 seconds for testing of a 3D cropped image with size of 64x64x64, using a DELL PRECISION Tower T7910, with two NVIDIA Titan Xp GPUs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTwo effective glioma grading methods on conventional MRI images using deep convolutional neural networks have been developed. Our methods are fully automated without manual specification of region-of-interests and selection of slices for model training, which are common in traditional machine learning based brain tumor grading methods. This methodology may play a crucial role in selecting effective treatment options and survival predictions without the need for surgical biopsy.","authors":[{"name":"Ying  Zhuge","ids":["50153301"]},{"name":"Holly  Ning","ids":["33048038"]},{"name":"Peter  Mathen","ids":["77928867"]},{"name":"Jason Y Cheng","ids":["48265549"]},{"name":"Andra V Krauze","ids":["34122040"]},{"name":"Kevin  Camphausen","ids":["2616783"]},{"name":"Robert W Miller","ids":["1932264886"]}],"inCitations":["39e38d3b8b23d7355996c82093775f7f3c360bb4","9a967f869e545fd1d8f0aa4f69f9fa857f5f1e66","ee63006ffba4cb5505e39e3a862c1934c911cc41","2ab9ff81c62b78b4b1242246f78f542e59a3111c","2ae33a0599ff5b2bd56b3d637cb7b36e9e285765","b4d78cd53b6ae1c0c5610e0b450f15f70e6bbd90","5bb0b5385102f975f8782eb7890fca3ad16ba11c","bb0bc7799b56a676c54d5a02fdbe03f978eb0817","7ffa545134e05eaf772eeb213472b1621a83bce7","1d14610777ac70cfbebed59a5d79c2406a6ff2d6","bcaf204ee40988161bd1bcdf316a5b050c62ec1f","e6745d600cf5d012e327b86283913139914b3543","1976d056ee398d539e00f47b2a391664247ca873","a075b423c3fdde8a499ec26a2af809f1b00df142","ce02567d12b6f6490b3182abb4b2e27fed5eca4c","83e78a5c59fd5e07d57cdb127cbbe9cd4777dd15"],"outCitations":["b4cf87c56427a9e02b1929d25a7696a29e4d0d7c","9edc90690383c66b3a4f5674a6fc84c26ee09cf2","116341164d1391678d212919f3e6fa1f47a55a1f","cd305de5967c53759ac833476628168f619346a6","f31ebb813d2d3d72887ba34cd64f95ba893a180e","b4d6523fa92b576223753744042bb3b5607ecadf","ab5716fcabcdf2a1359d7140913e140287190cf0","ea99a5535388196d0d44be5b4d7dd02029a43bb2","a5615560db291a88bce5019bb7f97841f5bb6842","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","cdbe696733259370ce061c083d69be190b1aaff1","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","a100c3254946b1a53b11a09f12f02060a9f786e9","e8e3e470c83df758119f683b5f00af93777473fc","731025c215d5573915f50c7b96d00df9e9044195","e92e8afe2c218fe0f807ace0ff9593d6ae316765","6ecc91743aea2d9f747c670065c3eff0b1b0e689","0ef8cdfa7001bd16d2c41d2b659558b1f15393f3","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","e7e245cf1e9508b82138f2b406f14cc7ca7884ea","bb4963787bc65406e665ee1d6a4298b8fe3b4f8b","61500809aa7f66bcd100a32281b1db54ea33ee71","a63d0576a8ebbb2ddeef6b84f86311c87ba0cdac","21de3a36cb51adc205fad8a1d3d69118891dc3dd","b9b4e05faa194e5022edd9eb9dd07e3d675c2b36","90042585974fc98abb6823e882e73bc0a0a81c39","32c42de64130b3b8b012360f7c4ce87903bb4298","fa92c576c25c534fa4dacde5461cfbf47ce2e74a","f9d79b7d72007a7e66351446c9e9b096a9b8bbea","e15cf50aa89fee8535703b9f9512fca5bfc43327","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","da74769ff7af1bb80ff89d730377a5328e1d7b71","9a0ef2e00a28623c49b695ec6088ea1d965db257","1a9109295134c6abb160eb68b85b2f44fc5614dc","c83c72d26ca8d4152150f1ccbbb180542662cdfa","8a8194daf7a064fbc75b9ad555be0f472f504d1b","1b47265245e8db53a553049dcb27ed3e495fd625","3bda8b8dd09117f7d5abc12cf4581ac50b6412ee","082650310f627fcc5debbb9e23112ab678aa46fc","420f3f1078a6d8e0696572c032877079286051c6","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d3526604c18e0d47ada8008a3b5bb8bdcdbc11e","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Medical physics","journalName":"Medical physics","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1002/mp.14168","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14168","pmid":"32277478","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"3015500759","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"3c6697086b7fa8d82a6ba151fcd174a60bb9aee3","title":"Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network to Address Atypical Anatomy in Modality Transfer","paperAbstract":"Recently, interest in MR-only treatment planning using synthetic CTs (synCTs) has grown rapidly in radiation therapy. However, developing class solutions for medical images that contain atypical anatomy remains a major limitation. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial attention-guided generative adversarial network (attention-GAN) model to generate accurate synCTs using T1-weighted MRI images as the input to address atypical anatomy. Experimental results on fifteen brain cancer patients show that attention-GAN outperformed existing synCT models and achieved an average MAE of 85.22$\\pm$12.08, 232.41$\\pm$60.86, 246.38$\\pm$42.67 Hounsfield units between synCT and CT-SIM across the entire head, bone and air regions, respectively. Qualitative analysis shows that attention-GAN has the ability to use spatially focused areas to better handle outliers, areas with complex anatomy or post-surgical regions, and thus offer strong potential for supporting near real-time MR-only treatment planning.","authors":[{"name":"Hajar  Emami","ids":["71134752"]},{"name":"Ming  Dong","ids":["144964053"]},{"name":"Carri K.

Another problem with the clustering algorithms is the selection of initial centroids randomly, which affects not only the final result but also decreases the convergence rate. Optimal selection of initial centroids through optimization algorithms like Firefly or Fuzzy Firefly algorithms provide partial solution to this problem. In this paper, we focus on two kernels; Gaussian and Hyper-tangent and use both Firefly and Fuzzy Firefly algorithms separately along with algorithms like FCM, IFCM and RFCM and analyse their efficiency using two measures DB and D. Our analysis concludes that RFCM with Hyper-tangent kernel and fuzzy firefly produce the best results with fastest convergence rate. We use the two images; MRI scan of a human brain and blood cancer cells for our analysis.","authors":[{"name":"B. K.

We propose a low-rank tensor model that exploits correlation across both diffusion-induced signal decays and neighboring k-space samples, to accelerate the acquisition of DWI using an extended range of b-values (0 s/mm2 to 2500 s/mm2) and limited (orthogonal only) diffusion directions, an imaging scheme that is increasingly used for brain gliomas evaluation. A phase constraint accounts for phase variations between b-values is also applied. Our method integrates parallel imaging and partial Fourier acquisition naturally, and undersamples along phase-encoding direction only. Reconstruction results using both patient and simulated data with an acceleration factor of 8 show improved SNR and reduced aliasing, as compared to parallel imaging only method as well as two other low-rank model-based methods.","authors":[{"name":"Lianli  Liu","ids":["120095499"]},{"name":"Adam  Johansson","ids":["49432644"]},{"name":"James M.

However, developing class solutions for medical images that contain atypical anatomy remains a major limitation. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial attention-guided generative adversarial network (attention-GAN) model to generate accurate synCTs using Tl-weighted MRI images as the input to address atypical anatomy. Experimental results on fifteen brain cancer patients show that attention-GAN outperformed existing synCT models and achieved an average MAE of 85.22±12.08, 232.41±60.86, 246.38±42.67 Hounsfield units between synCT and CT-SIM across the entire head, bone and air regions, respectively. Qualitative analysis shows that attention-GAN has the ability to use spatially focused areas to better handle outliers, areas with complex anatomy or post-surgical regions, and thus offer strong potential for supporting near real-time MR-only treatment planning.","authors":[{"name":"Hajar  Emami","ids":["71134752"]},{"name":"Ming  Dong","ids":["144964053"]},{"name":"Carri K.

Breast cancer is the most common and second leading cause of death in females after lung cancer, while brain strokes are among the common causes of permanent disability or death worldwide with more than 15 million people getting affected annually according to statistics. Breast cancer in its early stages is not much harmful and can be treated with a high success rate if diagnosed accurately. Hence the critical factor is to have a system to detect it in the early stages reliably. During a brain stroke, abnormal blood flow inside the head of the patient starts, which can result in devastating changes in the brain or, at worst, lead to death. On-the-spot accurate detection and monitoring employing head imaging in the post-acute stage are of utmost importance for appropriate medication for ensuring the proper care and complete recovery of the patient. Currently available standard imaging tools such as X-Ray Mammography, which is considered as gold standard for breast cancer detection, while MRI and CT, the most common stroke monitoring techniques, are limited due to their cost, size, use of ionizing radiations and low reliability. These limitations encouraged us to design alternative imaging techniques, to overcome their limitations and to get reliable results. The work done in this thesis is in the framework of designing highly efficient, low cost, low power, and reliable Microwave imaging (MI) systems to detect breast cancer and to monitor brain stroke. MI systems have the advantage of using low ionizing radiations, low cost, easy of use and are capable of producing reliable results. The designed MI system for breast cancer detection is compact because it uses components off-the-shelf (COTS) to transmit and receive microwave signals, instead of heavy lab equipment like Vector Network Analyzers (VNA) which other MI systems usually use. I-MUSIC is the preferred imaging algorithm for the designed MI system over other common proposed approaches because it provides many processing and practical advantages over them. Measurements are performed on 2D, and 3D breast phantoms having properties similar to normal breast tissues and tumor and the results obtained from the designed MI system are compared with the results obtained with the VNA based MI system. The results from the designed COTS-based MI systems are very similar to the results obtained with VNA and in some cases even better. Moreover, the acceleration of the computationally intensive parts of the algorithm due to the implementation of hardware acceleration in the FPGA of Zynq SoC (a development and evaluation board), increased the execution time of the algorithm 20 times faster than its execution in a highperformance server. The designed MI subsystem in this thesis for stroke monitoring, is a low cost, low power and portable system. The imaging algorithm used for stroke monitoring is Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD), different from I-MUSIC. In this algorithm, signals are acquired at a single frequency, and the execution of the algorithm for image reconstruction is much faster. The algorithm detects the variation of the blood mass across two successive data, and then the reconstructed image shows this variation. Moreover, the imaging algorithm is accelerated due to the implementation of hardware accelerator in the FPGA of the Zynq SoC and the obtained results are at least five times faster than the software execution of the algorithm. Both the MI systems presented in the thesis successfully produced very reliable results, and at the same time they were low cost, compact, consumed very low power with fast execution times.","authors":[{"name":"Imran  Sarwar","ids":["2085904828"]}],"inCitations":["ddf78a3670d4b5063406521aa352439e18727494"],"outCitations":[],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e957ddd4c43d67770a9034e4916270f819b29236","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://iris.polito.it/retrieve/handle/11583/2734429/248645/abstract.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-164","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2947832972","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"b8905947e8389c8f341a34525eb7807d4c3becc6","title":"Structural a priori information in near-infrared optical tomography","paperAbstract":"Recent interest in the use of dual modality imaging in the field of optical Near Infrared (NIR) Tomography has increased, specifically with use of structural information, from for example, MRI. Although MRI images provide high resolution structural information about tissue, they lack the contrast and functional information needed to investigate physiology, whereas NIR data has been established as a high contrast imaging modality, but one which suffers from low resolution. To this effect, the use of dual modality data has been shown to increase the qualitative and quantitative accuracy of clinical information that can be obtained from tissue. Results so far have indicated that providing accurate apriori structural information is available, such dual modality imaging techniques can be used for the detection and characterization of breast cancer in-vivo, as well as the investigation of brain function and physiology in both human and small animal studies. Although there has been much interest and research into the best suitable and robust use of a-priori structural information within the reconstruction of optical properties of tissue, little work has been done into the investigation of how much accuracy is needed from the structural MRI images in order to obtain the most clinically reliable information. In this paper, we will present and demonstrate the two most common application of a-priori information into image reconstruction, namely soft and hard priori. The effect of inaccuracies of the a-priori structural information within the reconstructed NIR images are presented showing that providing that the error of the a-priori information is within 20% in terms of size and location, adequate NIR images can be reconstructed.","authors":[{"name":"Hamid  Dehghani","ids":["144412183"]},{"name":"Colin M.

BM lesions can present as punctate (1 mm) foci, requiring high-precision Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in order to prevent inadequate or delayed BM treatment. However, BM lesion detection remains challenging partly due to their structural similarities to normal structures (e.g., vasculature). We propose a BM-detection framework using a single-sequence gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted 3D MRI dataset. The framework focuses on the detection of smaller (<15 mm) BM lesions and consists of: (1) candidate-selection stage, using Laplacian of Gaussian approach for highlighting parts of an MRI volume holding higher BM occurrence probabilities, and (2) detection stage that iteratively processes cropped region-of-interest volumes centered by candidates using a custom-built 3D convolutional neural network (“CropNet”). Data is augmented extensively during training via a pipeline consisting of random ga mma correction and elastic deformation stages; the framework thereby maintains its invariance for a plausible range of BM shape and intensity representations. This approach is tested using five-fold cross-validation on 217 datasets from 158 patients, with training and testing groups randomized per patient to eliminate learning bias. The BM database included lesions with a mean diameter of ∼5.4 mm and a mean volume of ∼160 mm3. For 90% BM-detection sensitivity, the framework produced on average 9.12 false-positive BM detections per patient (standard deviation of 3.49); for 85% sensitivity, the average number of false-positives declined to 5.85. Comparative analysis showed that the framework produces comparable BM-detection accuracy with the state-of-art approaches validated for significantly larger lesions.","authors":[{"name":"Engin  Dikici","ids":["40519485"]},{"name":"John L.

Because of the noise, inhomogeneous gray, diversity of tissue, bias among modalities, and the fuzzy boundaries between tumor and adjacent tissues in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tumor segmentation is a very difficult task. At present, many of the existing brain tumor segmentation methods are semi-automatic which are troublesome and inconvenient because interventions of raters or specialists are required. In this paper an automatic method, named wide residual network & pyramid pool network (WRN-PPNet), which can automatically segment glioma end to end is put forward. The main idea is described below. Firstly, WRN is used to extract features of multimodal brain tumor slices which are proved to have strong expressive ability. Secondly, the global prior representation with different level obtained by PPNet is stacked on the features from WRN. Finally, the scale recovery module in which the original inputs are fed into the network again is utilized to produce the pixel-level predictions which have the same size with the original inputs. Dice coefficients, sensitivity coefficient and predictive positivity value (PPV) coefficient are used to evaluate the performance of WRN-PPNet quantitatively. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a superior performance compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, and the average Dice, sensitivity and PPV on the randomly selected test data can reach 0.91, 0.94 and 0.89 respectively.","authors":[{"name":"Yu  Wang","ids":["33999202"]},{"name":"Changsheng  Li","ids":["49673319"]},{"name":"Ting  Zhu","ids":["2072834222"]},{"name":"Jingyang  Zhang","ids":["2108123095"]}],"inCitations":["808558a8d2e99657754cb095e29fe9fd1ded5daa","9b43649b936490df1a074d034c814b842c5433e6","a29a2ae24903adef479ce0b865759d4cb715a247","e50f6e8a266084b50c3c8b14766e928555fad756","5c107f5aa33e3e5d3b3ea9dc17e04a51765b0983","97e2eb4d8ddccca8f3c4835ee89ac4617ee52e6a","e2e4df0c70d36ac1a40d8861278263719379072e","e2abcbc2b5dcb514fe428fe3177b499e51b9e756","eab7d2950171ca2abee89a707e13f2c3d07fb420","833148c6c4e960ebba1b6e1c78f33f5ae489a5d8","1cd656c368946ab1743fb223c9e68be9d17bc784","5d749023186124893500356cfa8c71fd464dd1bd","e93d60f8b6f9906913c618717ef19bb045f19276","2f46000daa9eda6cc420443be6eec8f9e4003dc0","d5fa9d73896acdb1a8f338dc50f8563bf29663cf"],"outCitations":["370ff80fcafce482337327333cb9bf26f17af8c0","9a7578950115ba7326e1a491e0f2f93445c59cbc","552c8f36f3d419fdccdc2c1ea4b392d108b7e86f","d952e3ef252564f5697937707dcabb3c46a44edc","b7b915d508987b73b61eccd2b237e7ed099a2d29","b760e1cb7dc6d7088af687f96d469937856d5a94","1031a69923b80ad01cf3fbb703d10757a80e699b","7c2bcf6f32b05a04cd3444c030db743e5666af88","a56c42dcf6c313bfa3eb821d17a73733c3cd27c7","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","1c4e9156ca07705531e45960b7a919dc473abb51","14ec3a303013f296cbfa396cbe7677505b85c41e","776d9e705c8d27c3a71219e72128e8285119a39e","317aee7fc081f2b137a85c4f20129007fd8e717e","1fbcfb8bc93a982797ca8afee1d18a9f51ee8e99","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","88fab261b4e95126db22c432966bf5848503a19d","6dc07d95e339123bdd0d1b2cf0582ec9834317fc","68081285826abc283a62f98619d0b6dc014297b1","e086a3381ea78355873bd91e738a04c63fd8f6e5","e0067a9c3f30aab46d9e6f8844dc36e83c85869f","da74769ff7af1bb80ff89d730377a5328e1d7b71","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","28b21a79c9843e61e87b9a87216b755a1f8fa26b","54378aef6ec3423ad44d61de61b301be9f5c686d","e97d76194701469c6b138585292a01d4779009f5","c9007b1bb831993442b91d067cb4d6dc0a1dea51","97efa3acd4a45b28f3c9e25c961a9379abdc811b","0cc4baae4f621e64826534c575d3870d6f49d37d","2173f1b8172c9b5bed4650c81b69988717bd6df6","420f3f1078a6d8e0696572c032877079286051c6","1a727a86d9ca0a2bb26666334aa638ae22f98fe9","195df1106f4d7aff0e9cb609358abbf80f54a716","22fb19ef6a2b8c0431ebdf621609b4e93f59b0a6","3a35746fa5e848c785ad9b9d986d58f5a951bf5e","14a1133b50ef24c91630be34b17a7a96b7cf23d9","0d5170f30d43957054654839be92ad8802f19493","5f47c204ff83dafbef794e62611e217018b9e45f","80acb321ba193213a8ea3e94b74aad5e10e4b4b5","97f36e39af4db947a61900369015612722709c77"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3645b14ea8bf01f89f80587135fd5fa3fb7d5cca","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q92464117"],"venue":"Comput.

To enhance the estimation of the tumour extent one may use a mathematical model. As the brain structure plays an important role for the cell migration, it has to be included in such a model. This is done via diffusion-MRI data. We set up a multiscale model class accounting among others for integrin-mediated movement of cancer cells in the brain tissue, and the integrin-mediated proliferation. Moreover, we model a novel chemotherapy in combination with standard radiotherapy. \n \nThereby, we start on the cellular scale in order to describe migration. Then we deduce mean-field equations on the mesoscopic (cell density) scale on which we also incorporate cell proliferation. To reduce the phase space of the mesoscopic equation, we use parabolic scaling and deduce an effective description in the form of a reaction-convection-diffusion equation on the macroscopic spatio-temporal scale. On this scale we perform three dimensional numerical simulations for the tumour cell density, thereby incorporating real diffusion tensor imaging data. To this aim, we present programmes for the data processing taking the raw medical data and processing it to the form to be included in the numerical simulation. Thanks to the reduction of the phase space, the numerical simulations are fast enough to enable application in clinical practice.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander  Hunt","ids":["49608814"]}],"inCitations":["0b0b20661bccab0070220b07151ee7b99b1147ac","6dbb9bcbc8a8b326b98ec373ca5c693250475a66","0a20a3c8a9874805acb056d201aa6bbd01979d2d"],"outCitations":["5c2ae0f05cfd6630f6b130e12b1ac6c8269d661d","5fffc6042d9ef9ac1383cb8f7d338280f3efab24","0109c89768a127b508cd27f6dad9ffdf1d85d7a2","24e1434e8c41a1b1d1091b19e8b3454c650f71b1","7709e049cc607e679c29e1c67149c217fc712857","d9cfbd0dd408d39dea1572f3d10569a8c1edc86c","8a75d607955ea9eac90619e727101150bec6356e","aaeea34cd86a0dbcfbbfe2c93471b3b667c2b3dc","d3b7a0c61e2ddec8c68f6b3947e21c3e73755c4c","fd47d55fd8f7883477f4a1eb62fcb99af246190a","e306d3e63c050ee333cebc9b40e29f223f07d056","bafee0a9e85ae2f7924d9ab9a22877e4af399d51","f168dab0039950ed08fb21f08ca1f82eb6654268","dbf076a7d96e07649f9a26b3e13a875b7251652a","cf5bfc8580f961ac59a4ab0b14b44eaa205ae225","8f3fc7cb3acd721015a5926b91499d5fb2dde707","18c1f13bf2af5a9efb0126b7bd4683fa1b786532","b55405510efd616c3ef6cdcbf2fcbae74e55a9a5","a4dcf00e320e0cef8c1e071fe37cf64bc7f51845","27e05f4e2acffdf7a2d1dbdba6ea460bd4a96c40","33776c4b3b0ff191f6c78ae359a5544fc916d58a","7f4c67fe9cfe9993c4d1ccd2e6d48e435ecc1771","56cce02610c43fd7dfe859034ad6a8511d305ec5","bf1f24263832cdeeedbcad36ad9ed45ba306995f","223cca78738bf244a32d0d8678d93aa1d8610af2","85adb8dc6e3f3e9210382c7281ac0ac91f367006","3a0b77a5de314b7a1f30e8dc6ff4b713db88f6a6","f6aff5c1f185ac4eeb40e5d16aab15ad6189d50c","f798e370c0429defb12b463babb0e5e60debb8c7","34e4a452093855a53a329c82747edba901475544","f7eea3b1ca4fa4f8c371e55e0d125af1249b28c5","165120ff3d6085053374948c483c7b2887ca7768","24d3c6caeb1f143a85109c096c3235242c7fe42c","72afcffc28ea7cffac4e968d927ba22e2b0bf4d3","2a04aa0c8934296ad99183067ed8dbe8d7a93e56","90061ab4d4f87e1a3ffab296f2981bbb7a49971c","6095f801faa2ad560152a9bbb1438a0bcfc79929","985dabf9bc2edfb35056d05248b4edd05765689a","bba189cb59df2f9e8d03829fe6e66b8e67dc529c","9c33f961d6c4fc2c584643122a236653625ed6a7","523c8243e2933e0c0ee28150273c59f14d19fb22","294636c5b0f75994bdd61c5f77d11f1aaaddc751","1a6dd38b61a6edc932fc2680732d6932506a0f27","83ac4a26494cb014a3197026c65f5bbc30828734","3924b907221bb0eb34fa86c7271b2233ac91c1cd","465ca09a5edf9df493eb8e49e89b0ac5f0457b5b","632135925821ca5fdfa6058ba09987a8dba260de","6424c8f297e27492cbca0744d2bbfc33d9e428de","eec7c65ca9998a69c8ddda9d707c6b9c02a40e33","e22e5b1cd88d2ac750c0ce3c3df54268fadb2904","a27c98b3e2add526824bd9fb8d8b94cb27fd1892","8811cebba01b88ae19624eaf5c8fe09f82e6342c","83e9dcdc3b4d61e7fc742715ccfcc74595b668db","43c9fd11d63f947e512868116b06b00f936789c8","d1b2c3be96366ce781d041cc28c2614c9b0a04b3","698b82a0d13496b240811f42cf1ad841477ac7a9","a15dd15d30ff76872cb2ed7e74ad7a5af3907472","6ace306c10d630cd3851bbcdc288e08ca7597a88","946b4510df49b65ac69f88cd38fa71149d7d52a6","4cafeb12b999b19f429ea327dbeab6fa14824365","c80a82831176dd929335862bf40ed4accb9e5bd5","3fe5532f835f54285c194d2d96872e5529c1d73d","dafb0b915052adf8613ec9e33c9243d7a18a4c62","ad79e07c571a8a91d54465c760e2330f9c047263","ae937acc1e412573df643874e2c8d4145242127e","155f76dc7575f27f40ad43b07c4d89a1ef444d95","171a22ea0b3ba152f280a93d93fdae6c12f37ecf","88d8040019f01c6cb1b064194585327654035432","b4b289de36b757489ae5b61b96db150f0698c95f","df9ce48f01525dc3ea2b5a2b3b071b2a3ed83400","eba11b6f760c2a4b4f80d546519c001f5f2f3662","e4c88e6b05a2853d55cf7e6be445f5baf105f50d","6165e571a1a16eb96995233e0d646303c32a9adf","7db29d0c74f173abb3041ee28950dbb2745d7728","4ef21f3b830db7307cd754b39589211adf7e4135","abec7d393f9678de9484e459f6bf0f0b060a237f"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e54d99f895592ccfa8221d4800b467fa9c94585a","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://kluedo.ub.uni-kl.de/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/5357/file/_DissertationAHunt_300DPI.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2888377012","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"1b57451a4ca205cf6ba9dde5b3b07e3f9d5abc9e","title":"Brain Tumor Discovery Using Image Preprocessing","paperAbstract":"The segmentation of attractive reverberation images assumes a critical job in therapeutic ields since it removes the required territory from the picture.

Such a non‐invasive imaging technique may be of particular interest for many diseases associated with pathological alterations of protein expression, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Specificity to mobile proteins was achieved by the selective measurement of intramolecular spin diffusion and the removal of semi‐solid macromolecular signal components by a correction procedure. For this purpose, the approach of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) was extended to a radiofrequency (RF) irradiation scheme at two different frequency offsets (dualCEST). Using protein model solutions, it was demonstrated that the dualCEST technique allows the calculation of an image contrast which is exclusively sensitive to changes in concentration, molecular size and the folding state of mobile proteins. With respect to application in humans, dualCEST overcomes the selectivity limitations at relatively low magnetic field strengths, and thus enables examinations on clinical MR scanners. The feasibility of dualCEST examinations in humans was verified by a proof‐of‐principle examination of a brain tumor patient at 3 T. With its specificity for the mobile fraction of the proteome, its comparable sensitivity to conventional water proton MRI and its applicability to clinical MR scanners, this technique represents a further step towards the non‐invasive imaging of proteomic changes in humans.","authors":[{"name":"Steffen  Goerke","ids":["48686473"]},{"name":"Johannes  Breitling","ids":["40934619"]},{"name":"Moritz  Zaiss","ids":["2433654"]},{"name":"Johannes  Windschuh","ids":["2152264"]},{"name":"Patrick  Kunz","ids":["2907064"]},{"name":"Patrick  Schuenke","ids":["3658706"]},{"name":"Daniel  Paech","ids":["3098141"]},{"name":"Dario L Longo","ids":["40335982"]},{"name":"Karel D Klika","ids":["3813554"]},{"name":"Mark E Ladd","ids":["143681072"]},{"name":"Peter  Bachert","ids":["2956229"]}],"inCitations":["10b1cfdd4956caff596d3a99b3add351a894fb92","afedd4d71f0ad8913946c5899dd57553689084f7","5a30c30e68a471390e3e4b6277ff07e91465ac32","30f61cb4971bb76dc453f912cc9e73852654e5d3","fd4f926614e9cf351d137e683301c001d231905c","7ccd69581042e313c13a7751088dde7cb6af6815","2d3cc66a16a0c4e8ba98239484aedac3a6e06d30","f6f280c0f83c65d8860f5bf47ee14ddfe7d13d08","62942239362eef30ea174373b3ff3d57acccbc6f","9d90404b695a1d3faf26119dc64f9205dfc9282b","570ce5e2718055726d88209cd3226ae3117a9fbe","3d10c55b5777afc75c55fb2654957e32630b1da6"],"outCitations":["218a62e7e5b20c0c6def75bf692d98d0aaeead54","7468cd3f9904918ef5e145209fbf8b479f33c1f9","7a69f6ea0a6eb3ba3acda3447d71262a0de39076","f30aeba4e72a9d41a6bfb75636ffef32a7c5e51c","c511ea7d32277515d5910c184b0a24166ed65e13","7b965712b170ddcd1fccd58a029130dd42d07fe4","3989cebffe422468d651fbabfc9450382b927b5c","11f0a01f434c659486803f5b2a403fc0b7584c5d","fa7e6a3e3835e62a97e52c4b5415d5d98b787a31","6824a88404f89bd83439f96ec4fa0626b32165dc","253dee9ce4071b2ccc82323cd7497b551a71d95d","87be07aacd3314565754dbbdc7a6437ec22fbcf5","9b9819292f4f5b20c7ef9970972cded301a9d094","371d1936fc1490fd1ea4cd802591c3b324531e4e","eb2c048c12e43c1989ce134dbf2dcf2897a40f30","497da20fd311ca8991b4b1961ff77ef0e280bf48","2f96b8a6d0989758d82c126b035d65e9b54b3d96","5b482dba47bbcc3b7c34108100eedd3ca547e2df","b3df1ec619ac5eb13778cc62930ef294ad1830a0","fd037381aab815573fffdfa95b3b96c5eedbe664","347a50a69c0c389c0e20099711f3a5a6c92feff2","5de53b41e125900ac9348cb690894583af684a5c","851e5f0f7455432e0cfa9dfb01fc5864d0059293","8061005bb9d42262a75139c9f4b2207a465c0968","ce4432016fe55d906b96027a52f55555f1ca06c6","f8b1c695b27f897682a540b94e1ff2e36e881f5e","5f699d4ebe9b34366e8c440b20cbcd6429f32a4a","28383edbc106fd6920e2956a145008f7e27a0696","a185d30487450942ba6e0058ffb108102ae7ca0c","460b24203ac6bc69319de2d3698f847cdf8fc612","575f4e7cfa0c052c6f41aca9452de1105c81bf7c","3e70f14fb8d0fc04b37571ec8e74f19598dc3544","e3346f7092f02625150177596aa2cb7272ba27a5","aa22cac7812192b4450f5240b64b215e520c6051","3a5b9c19a818757ae53a68bcae57d61e4a2ef3de","115d1b9eb6b0682c7d33f683e48740a345a8a5a3","6a2d4ffc2eafba32b3f531bedd92861a15bf9ae6","9ae8a875ccf562429eb93acffeba2e51a6430707","b08eeae455fde9bbfd9c7580c1b07d77cf34dc16","7924f399b279d18e7f6c2f8fd8d208c3acbecdcc","3398db060df22a12e3180f67b735642ea243e50e","8eaaad3879e5eb4b34555fb8d1176d51054242f3","7b389a120747532c36d7a49833cc5c45564c7191","629299de98cfeab7a39f631f856da94049e7e28d","bfdee70e016491a8fc72ba81ef744ebce0850afe","c9f9bf3300188426b3b02e9cf1c8df53dcc42a64","2124a41eba01bbad70a93eef495ea2b3d373a7af","2056eba2849a8c93caeda37a4cd2210285e50359","097d6883ac51d2f9a13637bd78703809f2a9a3ba","883e54044bc8620e460558f0485628b526d79ccb","791c9dee80efdf3ebe288997cea66912f1b10015","707c3666efe466aed8657e658d36974aa5a731be","dbb7dab65b2fc92073e76877ead6338c63454b96","281e1eef22b67bdbd65a91f0d02de222fd697dcd","aabb3624be29f43dee141e8f02d4eef4aa89854a","39cdc1959345b2de0071d7e2c7b64f4d53a70133","5641774105e5974f4a64c673a2c8e0637b589a3b","9112405cbc39565cc402e6aa2b959dd0f906cfaf","b8d3db065febe55a8c0c76a1bd421f4cde8b7cb8","5dc879034fd2e477c2ecac4273d5eb4768bb8e65","064253cfdc8ae3b84a029d119903707ddc22c3b5","b96751b45bacc1f3a4f9fa1129a286a9ad43b326"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2c3cb7327a4dfa52fcf14a676ecd59a583e27346","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.dkfz.de/funct_genome/PDF-Files/NMRiBiomed-31-2018-e3920.pdf"],"venue":"NMR in biomedicine","journalName":"NMR in Biomedicine","journalVolume":"31","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1002/nbm.3920","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.3920","pmid":"29672976","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2802953123","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"7c27ccfb9214c176703787b8bc30689824b0fded","title":"Deep learning model integrating features and novel classifiers fusion for brain tumor segmentation","paperAbstract":"Automatic and precise segmentation and classification of tumor area in medical images is still a challenging task in medical research. Most of the conventional neural network based models usefully connected or convolutional neural networks to perform segmentation and classification. In this research, we present deep learning models using long short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (ConvNet) for accurate brain tumor delineation from benchmark medical images. The two different models, that is, ConvNet and LSTM networks are trained using the same data set and combined to form an ensemble to improve the results. We used publicly available MICCAI BRATS 2015 brain cancer data set consisting of MRI images of four modalities T1, T2, T1c, and FLAIR. To enhance the quality of input images, multiple combinations of preprocessing methods such as noise removal, histogram equalization, and edge enhancement are formulated and best performer combination is applied. To cope with the class imbalance problem, class weighting is used in proposed models. The trained models are tested on validation data set taken from the same image set and results obtained from each model are reported. The individual score (accuracy) of ConvNet is found 75% whereas for LSTM based network produced 80% and ensemble fusion produced 82.29% accuracy.","authors":[{"name":"Sajid

and Support Vector Neural Network","paperAbstract":"The automatic classification of glioma on MR images has been widely used in the diagnosis and treatments of cancer. However, due to the shape of prostate varies significantly and low contrast with adjacent structures, the classification of MR images faces great challenges. Using information from MR images, CAD systems have been developed to benefit doctors in rapid diagnosis. CAD systems can provide the diagnosis depending upon the specific attributes present in the medical images. The present study proposes a comprehensive method for the diagnosis of the cancerous region in the MRI images. Here, after image noise reduction, optimal image segmentation based on support vector neural network algorithm is utilized. Afterward, an optimized feature extraction and feature selection based on a modified region growing optimization algorithm are proposed for improving the classification accuracy of brain images. Further, it is also proposed that the input MR brain image be de-noised using a non-local Euclidean median in non-subsampled contour-led space. Experimental results show the effectiveness of adversarial learning and SVNN on the classification of prostate MR images. At the same time, the proposed method achieves advanced results and outperforms most of the other existing methods on various evaluation metrics.","authors":[{"name":"A.

Our method explicitly splits the network into two distinct but complementary components: the feature extractor and the decision maker. While the former remains constant throughout training, a different decision maker is used on each new dataset. This enables end-to-end training of the feature extractor on heterogeneous datasets (here MRIs and CT scans) and organs (here prostate, lung and brain). The feature extractor learns features across all images, with two major benefits: (i) extended training data pool, and (ii) enforced generalization across different data. We show the effectiveness of our method by detecting cancerous masses in the SPIE-AAPM-NCI Prostate MR Classification data. Our training process integrates the SPIE-AAPM-NCI Lung CT Classification dataset as well as the Kaggle Brain MRI dataset, each paired with a separate decision maker, improving the AUC of the base network architecture on the Prostate MR dataset by 0.12 (18% relative increase) versus training on the prostate dataset alone. We also compare against standard end-to-end Transfer Learning over the same datasets for reference, which only improves the results by 0.04 (6% relative increase).","authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe  Cuccu","ids":["2004477"]},{"name":"Johan  Jobin","ids":["2059025300"]},{"name":"Julien  Clément","ids":["40570845"]},{"name":"Akansha  Bhardwaj","ids":["28972263"]},{"name":"Carolin  Reischauer","ids":["2642322"]},{"name":"Harriet  Thöny","ids":["2085440214"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["d31975a5542783f64b7eedcebb88f0aabcd3c477","a25fbcbbae1e8f79c4360d26aa11a3abf1a11972","84431e4e979a6442344c19387949b19b3d4d83d0","db8dbe07af7eebc1eed662be268592f00f4882e0","86cfa3c1324e704263cd7e39d9bed566c47f556e","cb54d6fe66f2ae433bb10847d528b491e0a7a5c2","27dfc81ab32e6e9f218267e7d420a5329f4a4f76","eb42cf88027de515750f230b23b1a057dc782108","7e14e44e1c5d71a721921bc2eba00c33038f2792","dc0c915827068345a47e0f36582faba701470f30","a39bd32c9cbeff1abf6419adc697b584a7f69b78","6c7caa724dcd82d60de383e447a97a9cd95d2570","251c39c1b9372f3055cd53d0001fc122bfb2e418","29bfbdf16d4b59c67085ab928cad384a44476cd5","49d8c442c38f228e6ddc7392d845151dab4b4db4","fb86245e6623502017940c796c01ed508c3d8208","1b02bd4ef5cbf6d6fe99c1e52814ae27c17cf96b","c19a8ab4f61288ff63ffb61ee68583dc998dc84d"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/965a5bdf0b5a9ed6963251f638f0ecf3dee0e2a0","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378042","https://exascale.info/assets/pdf/cuccu2020bigdata.pdf"],"venue":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","journalName":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"4842-4849","doi":"10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378042","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378042","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"fed22f6af74c139a6224db766272e7e5cb98a737","title":"TU-AB-BRA-07: Distortion-Free 3D Diffusion MRI On An MRI-Guided Radiotherapy System for Longitudinal Tumor Response Assessment.","paperAbstract":"PURPOSE\nTo develop a reliable, 3D distortion-free diffusion MRI technique for longitudinal tumor response assessment and MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy(RT).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA diffusion prepared 3D turbo spin echo readout (DP-TSE) sequence was developed and compared with the conventional diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar-imaging (DW-ssEPI) sequence in a commercially available diffusion phantom, and one head-and-neck and one brain cancer patient on an MRI-guided RT system (ViewRay). In phantom study, the geometric fidelity was quantified as the ratio between the left-right (RL) and anterior-posterior (AP) dimension. Ten slices were measured on DP-TSE, DW-ssEPI and standard TSE images where the later was used as the geometric reference. ADC accuracy was verified at both 0°C (reference ADC available) and room temperature with a range of diffusivity between 0.35 and 2.0*10-3 mm2 /s. The ADC reproducibility was assessed based on 8 room-temperature measurements on 6 different days. In the pilot single-slice in-vivo study, CT images were used as the geometric reference, and ADC maps from both diffusion sequences were compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDistortion and susceptive-related artifact were severe in DW-ssEPI, with significantly lower RL/AP ratio (0.9579±0.0163) than DP-TSE (0.9990±0.0031) and TSE (0.9995±0.0031). ADCs from the two diffusion sequences both matched well with the vendor-provided values at 0°C; however DW-ssEPI fails to provide accurate ADC for high diffusivity vials at room temperature due to high noise level (10 times higher than DP-TSE). The DP-TSE sequence had excellent ADC reproducibility with <4% ADC variation among 8 separate measurements. In patient study, DP-TSE exhibited substantially improved geometric reliability. ROI analysis in ADC maps generated from DP-TSE and DW-ssEPI showed <5% difference where high b-value images were excluded from the latter approach due to excessive noise level.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA diffusion MRI sequence with excellent geometric fidelity, accurate and highly reproducible ADC measurements was proposed for longitudinal tumor response assessment using an MRI-guided RT system.

Precise classification of brain tumor grade (low-grade and high-grade glioma) at an early stage plays a key role in successful prognosis and treatment planning. With recent advances in deep learning, artificial intelligence–enabled brain tumor grading systems can assist radiologists in the interpretation of medical images within seconds. The performance of deep learning techniques is, however, highly depended on the size of the annotated dataset. It is extremely challenging to label a large quantity of medical images, given the complexity and volume of medical data. In this work, we propose a novel transfer learning–based active learning framework to reduce the annotation cost while maintaining stability and robustness of the model performance for brain tumor classification. In this retrospective research, we employed a 2D slice–based approach to train and fine-tune our model on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) training dataset of 203 patients and a validation dataset of 66 patients which was used as the baseline. With our proposed method, the model achieved area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 82.89% on a separate test dataset of 66 patients, which was 2.92% higher than the baseline AUC while saving at least 40% of labeling cost. In order to further examine the robustness of our method, we created a balanced dataset, which underwent the same procedure. The model achieved AUC of 82% compared with AUC of 78.48% for the baseline, which reassures the robustness and stability of our proposed transfer learning augmented with active learning framework while significantly reducing the size of training data.","authors":[{"name":"Ruqian  Hao","ids":["38585497"]},{"name":"Khashayar  Namdar","ids":["1402946521"]},{"name":"Lin  Liu","ids":["49417134"]},{"name":"Farzad  Khalvati","ids":["2621021"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["eb42cf88027de515750f230b23b1a057dc782108","fbbd3381640dae2ca4b03ac7ed85bfec896929b8","0a0ef3a1c242b119aede522fd2faf88ae18e9057","6ac414a34739d4a1e88efec42a2d87562b45916b","1a87f6260e78c906c91d5f3b21bddb2df9514668","6b12ed47d5718d1e7b99ac9541aa5a0ee9bf5116","b9ede5f604668d0b62a306392cd03f47086e245e","7b5d24af1e88709225f20f6bfecfce5fff7c286e","603caed9430283db6c7f43169555c8d18e97a281","d0e0bf86b0c3bc539bfea0dd2d0e36b72607f96d","30f887f267d886d70c28ed6a1a11ebd7925d8b50","b1328df3c0d1262d500ed734f8bf977094c3b087","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","8d99d6e0eb89a4fda003fe481e7dd87956d4bede","32c42de64130b3b8b012360f7c4ce87903bb4298","61d2e5ab597ae57d12c27613315a441d184e64af","ccdc50de7a0602d3df5ed9bd9782565bbff2a8eb","4fac93866dd674756012c5219cd243c8a02ba2c2","ccd0756426eb257ba743b1d60dc12c720fa61c1f","71cdc2345df62d60a1ed88333a6101ce669663b0","f63d672bb97f001f260a3f7156dd2ca2255787d1","e3416a581b8efa9fc39844845fcf2999ab7f7446","2cebf0212380f83b7171fb5660f842c8d7043f60","fc37722bb49bfb716f4baf546891d78077e8bfca","b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541","e57340f9728db2fedc99ac90418ad07ee4cbba30","5f1b006b4647bd1ac12ac9d95c981ccec44b6a9f","b2d6ed5ecf272a65655621b76055764bedc7ea83","571f4226cb7fbaf2f771fe32c0e4f02b010a223a","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","c6d2d035ccb1dc0116b494b545ceed5dcaf9662e","4ef878f8fa9383dcf9343cccded9027d42a843b6","ab5716fcabcdf2a1359d7140913e140287190cf0","818826f356444f3daa3447755bf63f171f39ec47","e74f9b7f8eec6ba4704c206b93bc8079af3da4bd","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","04ff1fb1b7daaeee9a31d2a3418251bf6bbd2dec","5f9666e2e762b6df563da534934e750874a7976c","328f8ff0a749f3c1f1083a75fe90eddcf0c73997","b8504d447d358f48bc9e6b2d32314809794889c1","b4cf87c56427a9e02b1929d25a7696a29e4d0d7c"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/43edded3766b3e571d5ff38d2f7ecc76167de6c8","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09265","https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2021.635766","https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/635766/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/frai-04-635766.pdf?rscd=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''frai-04-635766.pdf&se=2021-07-06T05:54:11Z&sig=9yNjh3bE5y8ZPfntwqVd3zwMnPIVAVPZZTtYIRasUno%3D&sp=r&sr=b&sv=2018-03-28","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09265v1.pdf"],"venue":"Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence","journalName":"Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence","journalVolume":"4","journalPages":"","doi":"10.3389/frai.2021.635766","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2021.635766","pmid":"34079932","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Engineering","Biology","Medicine"],"magId":"3159990573","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"04d8303864808addb7773505df4a172bb1fef225","title":"Transfer Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation Models Across Modalities with Adversarial Networks","paperAbstract":"In this work, we present an approach to brain cancer segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) using Adversarial Networks, that have been successfully applied to several complex image processing problems in recent years. Most of the segmentation approaches presented in the literature exploit the data from all the contrast modalities typically acquired in the clinical practice: T1-weighted, T1-weighted contrast-enhanced, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR. Unfortunately, often not all these modalities are available for each patient. Accordingly, in this paper, we extended a previous segmentation approach based on Adversarial Networks to deal with this issue. In particular, we trained a segmentation model for each modality at once and evaluated the performances of these models. Thus, we investigated the possibility of transferring the best among these single-modality models to the other modalities. Our results suggest that such a transfer learning approach allows achieving better performances for almost all the target modalities.","authors":[{"name":"Edoardo  Giacomello","ids":["41018979"]},{"name":"Daniele  Loiacono","ids":["1775166"]},{"name":"Luca  Mainardi","ids":["153050198"]}],"inCitations":["273ac46d05ceb24d2bb3ff8ca42aec9c115463e9","5dfd68a4f10f5983a97f977c85bd089b8083c2c1","372e26d36bbe8b781b6e4d4e2071849dd2a50f62"],"outCitations":["757993ad8c3574857a01906d2b46a5909882a4fa","54e325aee6b2d476bbbb88615ac15e251c6e8214","1a07daa88a366c10afa80cbdf63ad1b5d0759d1e","081651b38ff7533550a3adfc1c00da333a8fe86c","102a580a89b7e9d5a6d8e79864db183d6b5fb6ad","ace3a819feaf6bad98b702d3140c3ee92f67582b","fac36fa1b809b71756c259f2c5db20add0cb0da0","656d4c0937d88248ad4f4a568779b3265cf9a061","dc08847b65953ef2ae3542e47b08b57a46b5ba34","2d81914c1855f2d2873fd5cc26897330b42c0472","fab702f1905e17c87f32e1317ca730d69a90aa6c","1201ae8a7576bcc04f0930a03bdd03dcb3ee2e32","7c2bcf6f32b05a04cd3444c030db743e5666af88","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","fcabf1c0f4a26431d4df95ddeec2b1dff9b3e928","50004c086ffd6a201a4b782281aaa930fbfe6ecf","ae1745dbe1fedad56235f22bbbb8926f6f9a8fb0","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","6a2ed19ac684022aa3186887cd4893484ab8f80c","cca996e54cd58c8e26c1c11ea058b8c3650c3dd4","4dcd536eddc1486c1da66aa6ceeef9f2568f137e","3fd2fd728c4bf3f891a1b6bfe9f44bda70029a4b","be0eab53e64d714bc3c1ece33430f22cc87d194a","c08a2cc3b4953646078ed75ed7f827375a8309b5","a14caead1c4867b57653d3b0165f6a829186f8a7","f38f21f9dbca18f30b8981d8f19fa5288d8c5b59","f5fff6736aa02f816ab5c9d384b4bb33de8933fa"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d8303864808addb7773505df4a172bb1fef225","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02717","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02717","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02717v1.pdf"],"venue":"ArXiv","journalName":"ArXiv","journalVolume":"abs/1910.02717","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Engineering","Computer Science","Mathematics"],"magId":"2977566559","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"086c68f501fdfb7eab5cf8e5faffd657af51a6bd","title":"Passive elastography: from organ to cell (Conference Presentation)","paperAbstract":"Elastography, sometimes referred as seismology of the human body, is an imaging modality recently implemented on medical ultrasound systems.

The second part, is devoted to the application of time reversal or noise correlation technique in the field of elastography. The idea, as in seismology, is to take advantage of shear waves naturally present in the human body due to muscles activities to construct shear elasticity map of soft tissues. It is thus a passive elastography approach since no shear wave sources are used.

Hypoxia is a hallmark trait in GBM that is known to be associated with angiogenesis, tumor growth, and resistance to conventional therapy, thereby limiting treatment options for GBM patients. There is thus an urgent clinical need for non-invasively capturing tumor hypoxia in GBM towards identifying a subset of patients who would likely benefit from anti-angiogenic therapies (bevacizumab) in the adjuvant setting. In this study, we employed radiomic descriptors to (a) capture molecular variations of tumor hypoxia on routine MRI that are otherwise not appreciable; and (b) employ the radiomic correlates of hypoxia to discriminate patients with short-term survival (STS, overall survival (OS) < 7 months), mid-term survival (MTS) (7 months16 months). A total of 97 studies (25 STS, 36 MTS, 36 LTS) with Gadolinium T1-contrast (Gd-T1c), T2w, and FLAIR protocols with their corresponding gene expression profiles were obtained from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. For each MRI study, necrotic, enhancing tumor, and edematous regions were segmented by an expert. A total of 30 radiomic descriptors (i.e. Haralick, Laws energy, Gabor) were extracted from every region across all three MRI protocols. By performing unsupervised clustering of the expression profile of hypoxia associated genes, a \"low\", \"medium\", or \"high\" index was defined for every study. Spearman correlation was then used to identify the most significantly correlated MRI features with the hypoxia index for every study. These features were further used to categorize each study as STS, MTS, and LTS using Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis. Our results revealed that the most significant features (p < 0.05) were identified as Laws energy and Haralick features that capture image heterogeneity on FLAIR and Gd-T1w sequences. We also found these radiomic features to be significantly associated with survival, distinguishing MTS from LTS (p=.005) and STS from LTS (p=.0008).","authors":[{"name":"Niha  Beig","ids":["14027104"]},{"name":"Jay  Patel","ids":["2070425854"]},{"name":"Prateek  Prasanna","ids":["39017169"]},{"name":"Sasan  Partovi","ids":["2565343"]},{"name":"Vinay  Varadan","ids":["1955124"]},{"name":"Anant  Madabhushi","ids":["1705442"]},{"name":"Pallavi  Tiwari","ids":["2344884"]}],"inCitations":["808558a8d2e99657754cb095e29fe9fd1ded5daa","3eed61e59bd2b06f0a2d76b318deb00925305252","18c0e4cad0952401abe65ac972f348f24b95297e","ed60fdf09304230a8b9d55ae92ad25bfa102b3bb","2ca9c8c09fe7b7fc7d8920bde9e419e1b26a1bbc","3230a9c5fb6256736a776e288beadfd0903f4e19","8782fb6c2649fcc430eab30122d2a448262c99c3","10dbd2730d683ed4789049a971bba766bd5b1729","ec0d762cd61c52ecd915387c9b22201744215ad2","3a0b090838bf2377a5cc2970b3aedf1dc25cb622"],"outCitations":["e468e08612b1448c7e814e3d32c4384a06cfbe3c","44d5d0bd64d2e849a6de206cb348d3b194de4d08","1ed51bc8dddfe8c9ad161942e1f7e329f3cc1f47","c3e978a210edae835fcc01e84d9d44349cd9992f","251c39c1b9372f3055cd53d0001fc122bfb2e418","fbf8dfccd3bf1db32f9822e6b1cb5ec40488e8e5","dc4d489d18e17ebf4d6323c6ff616ee332021cbd","5f8b8b74ee656c913fda3b2ec8fd795f51f4ef6a","97a2fc0768bd3aec841df3175fcfe49d48a1ec7d","c2c053b83033f46574019f7662fc2489c92acf02","13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986","c6cde0fa0f4206d00e71d92a415cabc6fb531123","b7ef9923a432e9b203438da8fc9c83a805a0c67a","8fd352ca7d1919b37229ba2541f22856ca92bb17","e7642eb8407a8bd3eaadc3269559dae2e3902663","816a89b45c399a313756dec1faacb6a36a5d7cec","99b66047a28bc105e318e2ed1e46fed13cd63dda","0b0400bd1c2b9ba65080534f09d34949a6cf6f14","995b94cb4246172843153414c1e6dc4cb004dbf4","5c9542a343c0aa10ad8187b967ae81ff2c26de75","a9ca82bad1f07f3783731a6ecc721da8f74481c8","cc3d220eddcacba4b635aea257713a077d55192e","a346ac3bc34b6cdb54bc769aa9565256114f5262","1a2e56c6454e276731abbd812959c58d4ef8eef0","2dc3b367cab7c1e1afbd7baf0af6ffa01a1e7e14","1fdb62555eb650662dbe2a6f3985d390861597c2"],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5dd5d709e574af249f33e2827fe90950fedb9b96","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2255694"],"venue":"Medical Imaging","journalName":"","journalVolume":"10134","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1117/12.2255694","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2255694","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Engineering","Medicine"],"magId":"2593140098","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"a350e1dcbfec6cc252d29cdd125ce437a20f3704","title":"Development of three-dimensional, ex vivo optical imaging","paperAbstract":"The ability to analyse tissue in 3-D at the mesoscopic scale (resolution: 2-50 µm) has proven essential in the study of whole specimens and individual organs. Techniques such as ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) have been successful in a number of applications. Although MRI has been used to image embryo development and gene expression in 3-D, its resolution is not sufficient to discriminate between the small structures in embryos and individual organs. Furthermore, since neither MRI nor X-ray CT are optical imaging techniques, none of them is able to make use of common staining techniques. 3-D images can be generated with confocal microscopy by focusing a laser beam to a point within the sample and collecting the fluorescent light coming from that specific plane, eliminating therefore out-of-focus light. However, the main drawback of this microscopy technique is the limited depth penetration of light (~1 mm). Tomographic techniques such as optical projection tomography (OPT) and light sheet fluorescence microscopy (also known as single plane illumination microscopy, SPIM) are novel methods that fulfil a requirement for imaging of specimens which are too large for confocal imaging and too small for conventional MRI. To allow sufficient depth penetration, these approaches require specimens to be rendered transparent via a process known as optical clearing, which can be achieved using a number of techniques. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to develop methods for threedimensional, ex vivo optical imaging. This required, in first instance, sample preparation to clear (render transparent) biological tissue. In this project several optical clearing techniques have been tested in order to find the optimal method per each kind of tissue, focusing on tumour tissue. Indeed, depending on its structure and composition (e.g. amount of lipids or pigments within the tissue) every tissue clears at a different degree. Though there is currently no literature reporting quantification of the degree of optical clearing. Hence a novel, spectroscopic technique for measuring the light attenuation in optically cleared samples is described in this thesis and evaluated on mouse brain. 5 Optical clearing was applied to the study of cancer. The main cancer model investigated in this report is colorectal carcinoma. Fluorescently labelled proteins were used to analyse the vascular network of colorectal xenograft tumours and to prove the effect of vascular disrupting agents on the vascular tumour network. Furthermore, optical clearing and fluorescent compounds were used for ex vivo analysis of perfusion of a human colorectal liver metastasis model.","authors":[{"name":"Angela Maria D'Esposito","ids":["1401230053"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a350e1dcbfec6cc252d29cdd125ce437a20f3704","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"2776722915","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"77a9f8e8db5913376eedbc7aaf93052e7f74a688","title":"Active deep neural network features selection for segmentation and recognition of brain tumors using MRI images","paperAbstract":"Abstract Glioma is a kind of brain tumor that can arise at a distinct location along with dissimilar appearance and size. The high-grade glioma (HGG) is a serious kind of cancer when compare to low-graded glioma (LGG). The manual diagnosis process of these tumors is tiring and time consuming. Therefore, in clinical practices, MRI is useful to assess gliomas as it provides essential information of tumor regions. In this manuscript, an active deep learning-based feature selection approach is suggested to segment and recognize brain tumors. Contrast enhancement is made in the primary step and supplied to SbDL for saliency map construction, which later converts into binarized form by applying simple thresholding. In the classification phase, the Inception V3 pre-trained CNN model is employed for deep feature extraction. These features are simply concatenated along with dominant rotated LBP (DRLBP) for better texture analysis. Later, the concatenated vector is optimized through particle swarm optimization (PSO), so as to classify using softmax classifier. The experiments are conducted in two phases. At first, the segmentation approach SbDL is validated on BRATS2017 and BRATS2018 datasets. The achieved dice score for the BRAST2017 dataset is 83.73% for core tumor, 93.7% for the whole tumor and 79.94% for enhanced tumor. For BRATS2018 dataset, dice score obtained is 88.34% (core), 91.2% (whole) and 81.84% (enhanced). At the second, the classification strategy is applied on BRATS2013, 2014, 2017 and 2018 with an average accuracy of more than 92%.

The nCSs are generated by loading Gd-DTPA and ultra-short gadonanotubes (GNTs) within the nanoporous matrix of systemically injectable silicon nanoporous particles (SiNPs) [1]. Gd-DTPA is a Gd-based contrast agent currently used in clinical practice. The GNTs consist of Gd3+-ion clusters encapsulated within carbon nanotube capsules, which are 20-80 nm in length and 1.3 nm in diameter. Nanoporous discoidal SiNPs are fabricated by combining optical lithography and electrochemical etching. Two different particle sizes (small 600×200 nm and large 1000×400 nm) and particle surface configurations (untargeted and RGD-4C targeted) are considered in this study. The nCSs are characterized in terms of (i) biodistribution in tumor bearing mice; (ii) MRI longitudinal relaxivity r1 and (iii) thermal ablation efficiency. The nCS accumulation in 6 organs (liver, spleen, heart, lungs, kidneys and brain) and in tumors is quantified by elemental silicon analysis through inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer. Organ accumulation is observed to highly dependent on particle shape and size. In tumors, the larger discoidal particles are observed to accumulate more than the smaller particles, with a percentage of injected dose per gram organ of about 5% and 1.5%, respectively. For RGD-4C targeted particles, the tumor accumulation percentages grow up to about 10% and 8% of the injected dose / gram tumor, respectively. For MRI applications, the nCSs exhibit a relaxivity enhancement up to 3-4 times the values of the original Gd-based imaging agent loaded (either Gd-DTPA or GNT). In particular, for the GNT loaded SiNPs, longitudinal relaxivities up to 160 mM-1s-1 per Gd3+-ions are measured at 1.5T, which are two orders of magnitude higher than for clinically available MRI agents (r1 = 4 mM-1s-1 per Gd3+-ions at 1.5T). Eventually, the nCS thermal ablating properties are characterized upon excitation through externally applied electromagnetic fields. High quality-factor resonators (0.5-300 MHz) with separated radio frequency -electric (up to 200 V/m) and -magnetic (up to 5 mT) fields are used for non-invasive nCS stimulation and fiber optic temperature sensors are used to map the associated temperature increase. The nCSs have shown both magnetic and dielectric rf losses and significant heating at 120 MHz. Mechanisms and efficiency of heating are discussed in terms of both magnetic and electric fields excitation, the concentration of nCSs, loading of GNTs into nCSs, frequency and power of the external generator.The multifunctionality and superior biodistribution performance of these nCSs could be effectively used in cancer imaging and treatment through alternative physical-based approaches.

The scale and complexity of these datasets is a big challenge to machine learning and data mining community as the data is of mixed type. The extraction of meaningful or desired information from these datasets provides knowledge in decision making process which in turn helps for the diagnosis and treatment of the diseases. Biomedical datasets are a collection of data with diverse types as it involves images, clinical studies, statistical reports etc. The recent researches have focused on different clustering and classification methods to manage and analyze the biomedical datasets. The objective of this chapter is to cluster or classify the patterns of interest from Brain MRI images, Liver disorder and Breast cancer datasets using efficient clustering methodologies. Among the different algorithms in data mining for clustering, classification, visualization and interpretation, K Means, Fuzzy C Means and Neural Networks(NN) are frequently used for clustering and classification of biomedical datasets. The performance of these methods are greatly influenced by the initialization of K value and its convergence speed.

Modified Histogram Equalization on Fuzzy based Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) is proposed for Dynamic Histogram Equalization which resolves this problem through image contrast enhancement. The details of an images are captured by smoothing and it uses Gaussian function to distribute pixel intensity to nearest pixel. It uses normal distribution and here blur is removed by applying Non subsampled Contourlet Transform. Then local maxima are calculated to extract dark and bright pixel values. The smoothed images are fuzzified with TSK (Takagi-Sugeno-Kang) model and it provides importance to all the local maxima intervals. An Improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is obtained by combining Galactic Swarm Optimization (GSO) with PSO which equalizes histogram of an image. FIPSO algorithm is used to the minimum contrast images of MRI brain images. Non-subsampled Contourlet transform (NSCT) based modified histogram equalization enhances image contrast. Here IPSO generates optimum values and these value are used to calculate cumulative distribution function in histogram equalization. The quality measures demonstrate that the current equalization technique attains highest performance against existing techniques in terms of brightness and contrast.","authors":[{"name":"Boyina Subrahmanyeswara Rao","ids":["1576505798"]}],"inCitations":["edede6909400b99e5a51475565df27b5e28f2455","2476b49694b84c1b92d2773f6c4be937824ace49","33e7d8197e8b4e11e83bf5da87c147f5dd264a28","6d597d08159601fd6cfa03922817285cf8c592ec","1cdaa8e319fff6bd8dba271eafe5e32813bf261b","bd4184694ddb6330c8cea72272c0bfdce144d5b5","7ac3a05897aaa43a371d481796f2786cef7ebb70","cfbf703ffef0ea2170a1b3135832676f5cc154f0","cac6022b90a626d83e522e0915920c025825fd52","1ecd39b7626b411c481e2ed80843d41cc3851964","27b814aac35090638815756fe9a9436631eaa0dd","1cb607870f3387386a4702792f4d1cc39b4f4df8","469620f1d59e1787fa1c39fd29bfbab35ecbaeb1","aba0b208e96315c8d390d550023c83c3304b0413"],"outCitations":["b776be9855f89c30cedc02368c3af44e92223663","2277bee564c5f6933ea1c4bea2f4bd4e20b6d081","234d3f3c5333bd124f61b80b1550befcc2ece60c","7e4a3bf695b0acc0617235d1efa0397bd47d4996","7ebcebd4fa537c2fdbd89abc32372b28190c6697","3246feb107dcf0bcf9b6d1e3299d2876db01eca6","43e97d0c8ab2527fe82153637ba634af0fb76514","ebaf6bacb9be64d74e3887b0e37a7b3386638082","787cc6d361dd10459603d1a77f99347eaa5ca8ff","d1bf36173a484a5ea110c7358e648fb4f41ad4da","342f9561c6b79fa28259b85ce1060c4de3d844b3","e17aebde473ae4a1f5386d322f590630198e142d","a322df5ede6faa2b2baf54e706245e8dffa4b0fb","09081933697144092acc03d3f0902245d849793e","8b59285d85244b8bbaad5fc967015bef8fcd4af9","65c76545275c899c438f79f614810ba58641b031","b69d38063dbfe242c34679f7095e841873493e41","6086ac25d925f70a38e4b23d01e91de5799bff1a","70f3be5abf9287a376f85d3a0175dfddacd5f44f","73681c980cfa01dbb9a7588e7cae1974a22c5d35","0f4ab5d6f1044973042cd0aec6c891857ece67ec","42df75080e14d32332b39ee5d91e83da8a914e34","472f68cf07113fca0a237b083c124ccb9b3bed4a","e7bb490c6550535f7714d53545b3e3e32a36aafd","df45515d54a8fa6f9df9c27d8f2744b286a69092","927be74cc9bb2c42c0e7aba239f0fb384fecfc25","f3f89c3e0264c4c7f8b3e8aab0b388f896fba493","cd853c46187db31a97701ee1e3715ebd7624a309","d0d76dd583665e808f664bfc14dad24d94f408b1"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/563d3278117ad378ca85a3c76d268b29bab17d4a","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106114"],"venue":"Appl.

It is a neurodegenerative disease that can cause cognitive impairment and memory deterioration. In recent years, the number of the elderly population is increasing, and the incidence of elderly diseases has increased significantly. The most representative of these diseases is Alzheimer’s disease. According to some data, the average survival time of Alzheimer’s disease patients is only 5.5 years, which is the “fourth killer” that endangers the health of the elderly after cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and cancer. According to conservative estimates of the International Federation of Alzheimer’s Diseases, the number of Alzheimer’s disease patients worldwide will increase to 75.62 million by 2030; by 2050, the number of patients will reach 135.46 million. Therefore, it is urgent to classify the course of Alzheimer’s disease. In this paper, support vector machine (SVM) model method is used to classify and predict different disease processes of Alzheimer’s disease based on structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging data, so as to help the auxiliary diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, the extracted MRI data and the SVM model are combined to obtain more accurate classification prediction results. The accuracy of classification and prediction is the best. According to the predicted results, the data characteristics related to diseases can be determined, which can provide a basis for clinical and basic research, etiology and pathological changes.","authors":[{"name":"Zhao  Fan","ids":["2004228043"]},{"name":"Fanyu  Xu","ids":["153215141"]},{"name":"Xuedan  Qi","ids":["2111814944"]},{"name":"Cai  Li","ids":["2118036404"]},{"name":"Lili  Yao","ids":["2106356273"]}],"inCitations":["05098ab826219af4221033477f4342fc4eba62c9","7a3068f90213e08d930ed0d0008d92bbbbf12d70","d0efd261e12c316a0a4f50c2f673af04a04b6200","5a3309fcdb399451901117680a0a9d05a89facc1","a7d9ba94d2ef17a68c2c582346ddbaff8800e5ec","92bfcebe0c9fa805a8ac3964f632095511427958"],"outCitations":["66b8e91842ec9e05ae7387d0068a072e0b5a529c","e5cc70481b109547e0cb5c7ff3dcbec98fa8a430","39034fc0d73535b5cd0b4ef61e6973b491171f62","1e1bfc2cc5aa1504ec435036d752c038526da57c","397e3f3900523c3ebcd6db5ecd42c6363eae5c44","6f45d5dd7e1c8aa37e50338127dc081ecabbf88b","2bcc8fc59824e458134f200ab1b182a0f6143a8e","31dabd90c797ae54958653cde9e6ccebce569c87","7c25b7cb044904d0fd5ea5f442493d6d125c5756","08a096bd66e47af1bf29e8996650ac25040c8ea4","5e660a315c4be08f00d3236827975e3532d13426","788e867e05df6ddf4c2316c5745cafa32278aef9","10ddeae2da9af51453e0613a56caef11e319ca16","739c1fb67524330399c3c9f4785203eac7dc7a0c","59de7a04d6f37d73f9ac3151ad65d7655e5c98bd","8b19127b70f9d6fbfe0d7140d58f448bcd9a7dfe","0aea3dcc5faa08f9cf42eef2e64dfa8c4264c217","5f2903312d1f67f427a250f329123cf7ffd3dc8f","30375ed9a751d52991a3025727fe96d317ceba8e","08baa827bdbec22857579e3b05c4e4a9ffec71bd","c63b7ebf731a7b24bb6314b713ed047c6f317999","c9cb3d53e391021c2745d406b842c16d87051272","83652a9d5047f8fd0d5773613fb0881285f8518d","330889935a518a7d9a34f0f225f24b7c079e9acc","0820fa8d8c59e119a40688f705a7a647ba5ca652","47cc9cb703f526bdc8152f5ab2547cdad538cbda","84130b880937f5ceb0ad6f27c9fd6b0277828aa4","5f8633e51d5266154847ebfafb87c124e0c5c109","d30cc3169f46d20be8c6daae23b560dfc94acbdd","baf2c7b85b748da4c80c3ae8f24e8f56e27da89d","f4929f01ddd1e41532889fb0d4a8914723dbf84b","73cc16a91da33c21e5e50f1a6f1cbb1d5f78e546"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1640095b28888dcc049eb0e7dd6016e43f862563","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-019-04495-0"],"venue":"Neural Computing and Applications","journalName":"Neural Computing and Applications","journalVolume":"32","journalPages":"1927-1936","doi":"10.1007/s00521-019-04495-0","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-019-04495-0","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Computer Science"],"magId":"2973083287","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"858baa34ada738ebfcc017e3db0a8b9a5b345469","title":"Brain tumor segmentation with Vander Lugt correlator based active contour","paperAbstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE\nThe manual segmentation of brain tumors from medical images is an error-prone, sensitive, and time-absorbing process. This paper presents an automatic and fast method of brain tumor segmentation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn the proposed method, a numerical simulation of the optical Vander Lugt correlator is used for automatically detecting the abnormal tissue region. The tumor filter, used in the simulated optical correlation, is tailored to all the brain tumor types and especially to the Glioblastoma, which considered to be the most aggressive cancer. The simulated optical correlation, computed between Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) and this filter, estimates precisely and automatically the initial contour inside the tumorous tissue. Further, in the segmentation part, the detected initial contour is used to define an active contour model and presenting the problematic as an energy minimization problem. As a result, this initial contour assists the algorithm to evolve an active contour model towards the exact tumor boundaries. Equally important, for a comparison purposes, we considered different active contour models and investigated their impact on the performance of the segmentation task. Several images from BRATS database with tumors anywhere in images and having different sizes, contrast, and shape, are used to test the proposed system. Furthermore, several performance metrics are computed to present an aggregate overview of the proposed method advantages.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe proposed method achieves a high accuracy in detecting the tumorous tissue by a parameter returned by the simulated optical correlation. In addition, the proposed method yields better performance compared to the active contour based methods with the averages of Sensitivity=0.9733, Dice coefficient = 0.9663, Hausdroff distance = 2.6540, Specificity = 0.9994, and faster with a computational time average of 0.4119 s per image.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults reported on BRATS database reveal that our proposed system improves over the recently published state-of-the-art methods in brain tumor detection and segmentation.","authors":[{"name":"Abdelaziz  Essadike","ids":["41031483"]},{"name":"Elhoussaine  Ouabida","ids":["8612680"]},{"name":"Abdenbi  Bouzid","ids":["8547041"]}],"inCitations":["81311ac03a9c89f45fc4eddeaaadc1a396138557","172c443ef70038477c3b01d32fffb648abb24d69","7b75e54f3fe59716998226112f5705e7b854e590","5f0ce1d4bbb30b019d80158726821aeba4da97c7","bb651f7122476054e36a9173d8eea77278f602d8","cb46d89976b5972e3b33ec647af05f09715f81ec","6a74d3e55833662b80ac97924aac268dbc583ceb","9a53f3939ddd89f9f061bcee96c3a9f11f29c512","d25900054d5d36a79369fc0f4df434eb7bafa21b","c90feb7a0e38f3a0cf7cfa4299429a13f4adfb35","a3bcd5b7f2e57cd046189b4441edb1b34a22b8f6","5ecce2a7a1be6a5e961ac751e79506c2e5ac3306","dacfe359d6213c4c74df4b6233305ba35b71cbff","f08f0519403dc87290e599864efb19345be4dd13","a7401776b0ada2c5e5a06a71c383bbdf99fe2c52","0dc908aff5cd5ca5b7beb150ab8cb8b5f825b1cc","124322c5c68233a0e8a1f800640af9c7645fa05b","e5c1b3a3530bea7de1c44f06364e4fe66917f4d2"],"outCitations":["70963ce79c6aab6478084ccfd0a4dcc2a2450b9c","aeadcbef84dfb7575b83fc14a819a4899347831a","580062407427236ced45253a2ff7df2e147a81e2","a1067e837c7cbbefb30f8324c1eacb1afde39fc6","e4179ac27a92410dbd9e83da4679d9d53a37f8b2","83c845fec6cc313c26c63fc0f7eaaadf6833b2a7","0415f311ab1c413629a74442973f995613aacf4a","2744091224f8554820a16525bac292c25df3c4ab","0f55559d2d6bf5eec43da7ef5ba75b8a03ad2a5c","02d3241705318f4326716261d7c64c133bf56f86","787e4527ad230ea039ba5cad17fb361551dfc3bf","80acb321ba193213a8ea3e94b74aad5e10e4b4b5","d8c86bd895d8271f9618966b7e95643b793980ba","441ff323c92331e655ce9ff896773fc00b55089a","21fe83935193a306b02f5c8eb6bfe51cbb547be9","765ccbf37a496449cd68630f062bb3215ad4067c","81110a8ac41ddac6ed911a1b38549f6717078220","79342f7a229ec6c78fddb1a04f9304dffdab8e9e","56e3d0579acfc94ff22e64c8144a502a5261b04d","7eae4f35a2b15be6daf388b390639be74789c2a0","a26e4157f27d91311767f9a7e37cb8c8ca0b5deb","add4ab70c0e6ecdbc1de15754a43558f306bb163","f8b3142bf319f9d2c54fd5dca2cad3bda3a1cc32"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/858baa34ada738ebfcc017e3db0a8b9a5b345469","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q53686083","http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/148225.pdf"],"venue":"Comput.

Using a single‐shot isotropic diffusion encoding (IDE) preparation, we eliminate signal confounds caused by anisotropic diffusion, including microscopic anisotropy, and acquire in vivo diffusion‐weighted images (DWIs) over a wide range of diffusion sensitizations. We analyze the measured IDE signal decays using a regularized inverse laplace transform (ILT) to derive a probability distribution of mean diffusivities of tissue water in each voxel. Based on numerical simulations we assess the sensitivity and accuracy of our ILT analysis and optimize an experimental protocol for use with clinical MRI scanners. In vivo spectra of intravoxel mean diffusivities measured in healthy subjects generally show single‐peak distributions throughout the brain parenchyma, with small differences in peak location and shape among white matter, cortical and subcortical gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. Mean diffusivity distributions (MDDs) with multiple peaks are observed primarily in voxels at tissue interfaces and are likely due to partial volume contributions. To quantify tissue‐specific MDDs with improved statistical power, we average voxel‐wise normalized MDDs in corresponding regions‐of‐interest (ROIs). This non‐parametric, rotation‐invariant assessment of isotropic diffusivities of tissue water may reflect important microstructural information, such as cell packing and cell size, and active physiological processes, such as water transport and exchange, which may enhance biological specificity in the clinical diagnosis and characterization of ischemic stroke, cancer, neuroinflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders and diseases. HighlightsWe optimize a clinical protocol to measure isotropic diffusion encoded brain images.We derive rotation‐invariant distributions of intravoxel mean diffusivities in vivo.We assess the uncertainty of measuring intravoxel mean diffusivity distributions.Mean diffusivities distributions show mostly single peaks in healthy brain voxels.","authors":[{"name":"Alexandru Vlad Avram","ids":["34603347"]},{"name":"Joelle E.

Many classification algorithms and clustering techniques are implemented to suit different types of data such as numeric, real, and nominal data types. Each classification and clustering algorithms are implemented in a certain approach. Some are linear and some are non-linear algorithms. In this paper, a comparison between some linear and non-linear classification algorithms has been conducted to study the performance of these classifiers with three different types of data set. The first data set is the collected MRI images of the brain tumor with type real, the second is diabetes data set with type numeric and the third is the breast cancer data set with type nominal. The linear classifiers chosen for this study are Lazy and Bayesian classifiers. While for the non-linear both Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Linear Vector Quantization (LVQ) are chosen. The results showed that the performance of the nonlinear classifiers was better than the linear classifiers with all data sets. In particular the accuracy rate of both MLP and LVQ with the real brain tumor data set is 91%, 83% respectively. On the other side, the linear classifiers showed comparable result with all datasets.","authors":[{"name":"Bahera H.

The REOS recursively segment individual OARs by ensembling images features extracted from an organ localization module and a contour detection module. Both modules are based on a 3D U-Net architecture. The organ localization module is trained for rough segmentation to localize a region of interest (ROI) that encompasses the to-be-delineated OAR, while the contour detection module is trained to segment the OAR within the identified ROI. In this study, the developed REOS framework is applied for brain radiotherapy on segmenting six OARs including the eyes, the brainstem (BS), the optical nerves and the chiasm. Eighty T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) from 80 brain cancer patients' cases with OARs' gold standard contours were collected for training and testing REOS. On 20 testing cases, the REOS achieve a high segmentation accuracy with Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) mean and standard deviation of 93.9%  ±  1.4%, 94.5%  ±  2.0%, 90.6%  ±  2.7%, on the left and right eyes and the BS, respectively. On small and segmentation-challenging organs, the left and right optical nerves and the chiasm, the REOS achieves DSC of 78.0%  ±  10.5%, 82.2%  ±  5.9% and 71.1%  ±  9.1%. The satisfactory performances demonstrated the effectiveness of the REOS in OARs segmentation.","authors":[{"name":"Haibin  Chen","ids":["47666286"]},{"name":"Weiguo  Lu","ids":["145734706"]},{"name":"Mingli  Chen","ids":["47110954"]},{"name":"Linghong  Zhou","ids":["2984289"]},{"name":"Robert  Timmerman","ids":["3717393"]},{"name":"Dan  Tu","ids":["3143729"]},{"name":"Lucien  Nedzi","ids":["3923765"]},{"name":"Zabi  Wardak","ids":["3412959"]},{"name":"Steve  Jiang","ids":["2129644"]},{"name":"Xin  Zhen","ids":["2730038"]},{"name":"Xuejun  Gu","ids":["2592078"]}],"inCitations":["56fee94547ac7b747b167557d177f9214531f208","fdd6288a4b174dc396613939da40272037d17182","83c12105fc895f3a4c0c526513db37a1bbd5c7d1","307900d629cb8a69bb1261c5136b71219788676a","4781d606397fe3898304bf5a84bebf61981e0bec","89d99936945972f86ec8fc771e88512295a13ac7","b3928729e3501c5b304211092b6406c7d1d555a3","758b2c38ab9437439306e78044f72338b9cf5c9b","301111210d7626dc9489ad50dc72885b5cbfcef7","6fb86b22648c4354c2d5c39e13114ed93661aaef","c916cdb8bcd558dc33dd1e412b9453569fd833a9","51b2e862be847b54b63e874ed86f8d3486bc98ab","bc83c8306ce999f1ba586a25f23fb952a9d0efb3","6015d2999cf61491003428cb16a4e575acd26f10"],"outCitations":["3693dc02a2a1d21232e37df0640c22183fd87f0b","10f021658d58b0035af3b252146bd4a1dc84c3a2","4d376d6978dad0374edfa6709c9556b42d3594d3","d860504ff0a3faaeeccf72e9a6c982b644ed16a2","7b6952ccc9958b43eb5fbbb56f7768a701ce2940","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","155a622634f29cdd469418c4613473e6ad2a0c5b","061a13583db4ed853dccffd345109747fcbdd65e","2d2f749180bf0efd69be8b95f61ad3d0ba29061f","39df6d28f0b32adc2f76c21307adfcc6470c2f0f","85efeeb25d8e363606d94c8fadaa922ba9b93a37","a538b05ebb01a40323997629e171c91aa28b8e2f","958ca20f5145cd5690b8c9c40b46174b3b76b4bb","50004c086ffd6a201a4b782281aaa930fbfe6ecf","f803bc6777a8c4c620b37a183d2a8f20483cb5cd","49ca9597280aa43d65df291d7991b25059cf8a3c","f78318366f17c43e5798e3a7eeaf922fdbf26e58","2d8edc4e38bf9907170238726ec902cb3739393b","0640f9ac79a8a4fa033c379f1cbde7033a41eeea","34f25a8704614163c4095b3ee2fc969b60de4698","e6e9f9bb62d477e2ffe7927dae254f8a75d12777","510ca89dafa2c434f130fdd7c456ece10b9967a7","372ca837f08e1020d501420b3577af71e94fdb0d","3f1186a399c9a99f4b20f5dd87dd2faf4d97e27e","83c845fec6cc313c26c63fc0f7eaaadf6833b2a7","2259661a269bf552a56a3f1bcac21daa40ba1669","1c2648c5423026b9ebca6f714eaef50d93fc10e1","8b78280ce99fc310523eea3040a3d58e9d880cc5","6cfd46365e757e8e54f34ffcdcbdbb888ad5c2a0","edd4fa1a95edab0fc698cd412216459e6819b7b9","a3f3d014d5ba20263621fb9dc865665a3b4983cc","fe61c4115c97737563344ac57e11340db6d76fab","23045299013e8738bc8eff73827ef8de256aef66","a205027a89b3b766699469174e30e77afe8423ea"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c07ecebfe0718d51b16e6102dbe5469de5c935e9","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Physics in medicine and biology","journalName":"Physics in medicine and biology","journalVolume":"64 2","journalPages":"\n          025015\n        ","doi":"10.1088/1361-6560/aaf83c","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560%2Faaf83c","pmid":"30540975","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2904368999","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"821188f833f7b3b9be2deb7fcaa44396ec95c01e","title":"Quantifying Pathology in Diffusion Weighted MRI","paperAbstract":"In this thesis algorithms are proposed for quantification of pathology in Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) data. Functional evidence for brain diseases can be explained by specific structural loss in the white matter of the brain. That is, certain biomarkers may exist where the disease inhibits improper functioning. Axonal and myelin sheath damage hamper neural connectivity. This can be assessed in vivo by measuring a change in the diffusion of water molecules. DW-MRI may deliver such biomarkers by capturing subtle changes in the diffusion process in an early disease stage. Diffusion tensor derived scalar measures such as the Mean Diffusivity and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) quantify this process. When comparing such measures on group level, patients may be found to significantly differ from healthy controls. Conventional analysis treats measurements in each voxel independently. Due to high inter-brain connectivity, we hypothesize that multiple brain regions are involved in complex brain diseases such as schizophrenia. We introduce a new machine learning framework for performing such analysis in comparative studies on volumetric data. By ‘shaving' the mapping computed by discriminant analysis, a characteristic set of regions is automatically extracted. We opt to ‘prune' the dataset by iteratively discarding misclassified subjects from the cohort, such that the mapping is based merely on representative prototypes. Then a comparison is made between a linear and non-linear kernel discriminant analysis, to identify the dimensionality of the problem. Methods are proposed for modeling the 30% of white matter that cannot be adequately described by a single tensor. These regions are currently disregarded in comparitive studies. More complex diffusion models that are introduced need to be adequately evaluated. We propose a new method for creating experimental phantom data of fiber crossings, by mixing the DWI-signals from high FA-regions. These models demand HARDI (High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging) data acquired with higher SNR, diffusion weighting and angular resolution. In comparitive studies, scanning time may be insufficient for meeting the requirements. We propose a method to create a dual tensor atlas from multiple coregistered non-HARDI datasets. The random fluctuations in the pose of subjects in the scanner as well as anatomical heterogeneity contribute to an increased angular resolution. Finally, we build an optimization framework for estimating both diffusion shape and orientation in fiber crossings. This work sets fundamental limits for comparative studies to correctly analyze crossing white matter structures. Firstly, it assesses the precision and accuracy with which parameters may be estimated. Secondly, the optimal acquisition parameters are selected in order to do so. This model allows for estimating consistent FA-profiles along crossing tracts. Fiber tracts provide a specific frame of reference for computing statistics. We perform 3D tract-based comparison of tensor-derived indices between groups. Inter-subject correspondence is achieved by non-rigid registration based on a joint clustering and matching. The clustering delivers atlas points that serve as a frame of reference for performing the analysis. Spatial consistency is taken to reflect a significant difference between groups. The potential of our methods is demonstrated in two comparative studies: on Childhood Cancer survivors and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis respectively. High throughput analysis of our data is realized by adopting a grid computing approach. The grid provides fast and easy access to shared resources. We present our progress over the past four years in the development and porting the DW-MRI analysis pipeline to grids. By doing do, our algorithms and results can also be accessed by fellow researchers.","authors":[{"name":"Matthan W. A.

Hyperthermia can be defined as the mild elevation of the temperature to 40–46 °C, which induces the cancer cell death and enhances the effects of the radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In the present research, the realistic geometry of the human head layers and the tumor are modelled, geometrically, and then simulated similar to the real samples of MRI images with the size of 5990 mm3. The temperature distribution in the tumor and healthy tissues was obtained based on the solution of Penne’s bio-heat transfer equation utilizing the Finite Element scheme. Employing the accurate boundary conditions for the thermal simulation of the problem, two main layers of the human brain, namely, white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM), as well as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the skull, are considered in the thermal analysis. In order to examine the hyperthermia conditions, the effects of the different blood perfusion rates and tumor metabolism on the tumor temperature are analyzed. The results showed that by reducing the blood perfusion rate from 0.0016 to 0.0005(ml/(ml.s)), the temperature increased by nearly 0.2 ℃ at the center of the tumor implying that the variations of the blood perfusion rate in the tumor have not a significant influence on its temperature. Moreover, it was found that when the tumor metabolism increases five times (equal to 125 × 103 W/m3) than its normal value (equal to 25,000 W/m3), the temperature reaches to the range needed for ablation of the brain tumor (40–46 ℃). The results also indicated that the manipulation of the cancer tissues metabolic rate via thermal simulation could be efficiently employed to estimate the amount of heat needed for the thermal ablation of the tumor.","authors":[{"name":"Adeleh  Kazemi Alamouti","ids":["2124056869"]},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Habibi","ids":["49729632"]},{"name":"Mohammad  Mazidi Sharfabadi","ids":["2124055715"]},{"name":"Hossein  Akbari Lalimi","ids":["2124055752"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["a864ada85a1c9420d80f8f31cae7faf274880579","0b3da6de834ca098f9f48b217be639c60bd89ecd","8d74764d302543e15f72d0d59bbcfcc9caa6f28d","af8e6d9abee95f082ad76155a89c02aea4370d49","cb1a2b69afa5a98585545a36627f21bc7db7e7d2","75b98e19f271a8de1f920990acff713f54b19101","1b29e720b048347b765af3fe8b8c07a37bc1b6c1","a2a90d5419eaef16e563060619aed382a1dc9a79","906bc9a768486b4e71d3545f37b76c003b8fde45","c98ae71f17498f559dca45408eb81ef3cb49fe07","a4cdd7bdf6c89f54425cd2e5a31119a122da9dd5","fbffed3b92bf52e8d803661191187c2fa70365df","1baac1bd281ce8cd244cc61a9eaee642064127c7","0753967bd29ac78bb956b813fbb1965fb07d352e","c328603cae569d1d9a8590fc746b4adda1d1e294","887f71679769b2062a98f86be0d6941d14cde750","4654b4a88cb737f3c32b0886ee1a87c63c27188b","676e197bf5b198f8bf48a505ea1478c5753d3f3e","eed2b0ffd509192e6d73e669b0fb286d80f4a3d3","36adb567a0638ef4b07818c92dfe415db582965f","af0cb7f420a935fb6e436a98cced646eba511973","23daf584743df8cc5b150c4d91d538892b287f09","6fb6fe9d1ff36bb137d9b11aeb7555d5ce7e030a","5260a0af06d511930babbdeb48b312690dbf7764","308c2c52005e0be1588bb625bc7fe22c108c5734"],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/16c23fe36251e37718c5ca21be9b158692b05600","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"3","journalPages":"1-17","doi":"10.1007/S42452-021-04447-1","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/S42452-021-04447-1","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"3138120661","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"73755811fd31d33563074991db8c3c0aab3cb835","title":"A Review on Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for WBCs Classification in Blood Smear Images","paperAbstract":"In computer vision, traditional machine learning (TML) and deep learning (DL) methods have significantly contributed to the advancements of medical image analysis (MIA) by enhancing prediction accuracy, leading to appropriate planning and diagnosis. These methods substantially improved the diagnoses of automatic brain tumor and leukemia/blood cancer detection and can assist the hematologist and doctors by providing a second opinion. This review provides an in-depth analysis of available TML and DL techniques for MIA with a significant focus on leukocytes classification in blood smear images and other medical imaging domains, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT images, X-ray, and ultrasounds. The proposed review’s main impact is to find the most suitable TML and DL techniques in MIA, especially for leukocyte classification in blood smear images. The advanced DL techniques, particularly the evolving convolutional neural networks-based models in the MIA domain, are deeply investigated in this review article. The related literature study reveals that mainstream TML methods are vastly applied to microscopic blood smear images for white blood cells (WBC) analysis. They provide valuable information to medical specialists and help diagnose various hematic diseases such as AIDS and blood cancer (Leukaemia). Based on WBC related literature study and its extensive analysis presented in this study, we derive future research directions for scientists and practitioners working in the MIA domain.","authors":[{"name":"Siraj  Khan","ids":["145771479"]},{"name":"Muhammad  Sajjad","ids":["143993371"]},{"name":"Tanveer  Hussain","ids":["144591441"]},{"name":"Amin

cancer","paperAbstract":"Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new minimally invasive technique to kill tumors and other undesirable tissue in a non-thermal manner. During an IRE treatment, a series of short and intense electric pulses are delivered to the region of interest to destabilize the cell membranes in the tissue and achieve spontaneous cell death. The alteration of the cellular membrane results in a dramatic increase in electrical conductivity during IRE as in other electroporation-based-therapies. In this study, we performed the planning and execution of an IRE brain cancer treatment using MRI reconstructions of the tumor and a multichannel array that served as a stereotactic fiducial and electrode guide. Using the tumor reconstructions within our numerical simulations, we developed equations relating the increase in tumor conductivity to calculated currents and volumes of tumor treated with IRE. We also correlated the experimental current measured during the procedure to an increase in tumor conductivity ranging between 3.42–3.67 times the baseline conductivity, confirming the physical phenomenon that has been detected in other tissues undergoing similar electroporation-based treatments.","authors":[{"name":"Paulo A.

There are two important, but quite different, possible definitions of the term \"performance\" in this context. One definition of performance is the time taken to execute an algorithm on a computer. On this dimension, an algorithm that requires less computation time is better. The other definition of performance relates to how frequently an algorithm results in a correct decision. On this dimension, a better algorithm is one that gives a correct decision more frequently. This chapter is concerned with measuring the performance of algorithms in this second sense. As one example, we want to be able to make meaningful statements of the form - \"Algorithm A performs better than algorithm B at detecting signs of cancer in medical images\" or \"Algorithm A performs better than algorithm B at registering CT and MRI images of the brain.\" It is only when algorithms have similar performance on this dimension that their relative computation time becomes of interest.","authors":[{"name":"Kevin W.

Using the statistical distribution in the parameter space, we have considered mean, median, and mode of the distribution, and found that the median and mode provide reasonably good estimates. We call the method Robust Rigid Registration by Multiples Estimates in Sampled data points (R3MES). It provides higher accuracy than the CMIR technique. When the number of iterations of multiple estimates is kept low, the R3MES technique requires less computation, as it works in the sampled data set. The performance of the R3MES technique is better when the sampling rate is greater than 3%. We present a theoretical validation of this observation, considering uniform sampling with replacement. We also demonstrate its application for registering 3D CBCT image volumes of a colo-rectal cancer patient captured on different days. To demonstrate its general applicability, we present its performance on registering a pair of 3D brain MRI image volumes.","authors":[{"name":"Sai Phani Kumar Malladi","ids":["8605609"]},{"name":"Bijju Kranthi Veduruparthi","ids":["7188927"]},{"name":"Jayanta  Mukhopadhyay","ids":["143769377"]},{"name":"Partha Pratim Das","ids":["1715276"]},{"name":"Saswat  Chakrabarti","ids":["1715486"]},{"name":"Indranil  Mallick","ids":["8382342"]}],"inCitations":["d710279bbf42d9e272d03fded32ce76d694c79c6"],"outCitations":["5ded548325e9e87b39c47000d92d84f22da43ef2","5d69c8a4e8d18528904a65d0f48758e31519abbf","df01d42352995c8808942373b102179d35541833","4a3df692dffdd232b0a014843315ebb6dd7b8303","1c168275c59ba382588350ee1443537f59978183","f0d9c0bbe34fd27f4fa69dac109127362db06d18","d5b692f690207d59fd21b19c4a510fd7c3f6caa8","017ddb7e815236defd0566bc46f6ed8401cc6ba6","0b2bc35ce8ff68b8c052cdf6c9ef156b614670c6","4718ebfc20023994221aae60551670d2d3abdbc5","5964e7db2d1e0ad4bcf239fe71142b81646c75d1","18327f49418e9380e8efb88d59c89449c472f84a","ae466aae94b7fb9944056249d7c5be2e8cdef280","a8393fb36b8789e2b058963f82855db7fff84963"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/506efb8cb8ba937708189c539f75b1975687021a","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2018.02.025"],"venue":"Pattern Recognit.

Classically, they account for pre-defined statistics of shape, texture, and other low-level image features. Alternatively, deep learning-based representations are derived from supervised learning but require expensive annotations and often suffer from overfitting and data imbalance issues. In this work, we address the challenge of learning the representation of a 3D medical image for an effective quantification under data imbalance. We propose a self-supervised representation learning framework to learn high-level features of 3D volumes as a complement to existing radiomics features. Specifically, we demonstrate how to learn image representations in a self-supervised fashion using a 3D Siamese network. More importantly, we deal with data imbalance by exploiting two unsupervised strategies: a) sample re-weighting, and b) balancing the composition of training batches. When combining the learned self-supervised feature with traditional radiomics, we show significant improvement in brain tumor classification and lung cancer staging tasks covering MRI and CT imaging modalities.

However, many studies are found to segment only the mass of interest and not all major tissues. Differences and inconsistencies in ultrasound interpretation call for an automated segmentation method to make results operator-independent. Furthermore, manual segmentation of entire three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound volumes is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and clinically impractical. Here, we propose an automated algorithm to segment 3D ultrasound volumes into three major tissue types: cyst/mass, fatty tissue, and fibro-glandular tissue. To test its efficacy and consistency, the proposed automated method was employed on a database of 21 cases of whole breast ultrasound. Experimental results show that our proposed method not only distinguishes fat and non-fat tissues correctly, but performs well in classifying cyst/mass. Comparison of density assessment between the automated method and manual segmentation demonstrates good consistency with an accuracy of 85.7%. Quantitative comparison of corresponding tissue volumes, which uses overlap ratio, gives an average similarity of 74.54%, consistent with values seen in MRI brain segmentations.

The global HE usually results in excessive contrast enhancement because of lack of control on the level of contrast enhancement. A new technique named modified histogram equalization using real coded genetic algorithm (MHERCGA) is aimed to sweep over this drawback. The primary aim of this paper is to obtain an enhanced method which keeps the original brightness. This method incorporates a provision to have a control over the level of contrast enhancement and applicable for all types of image including low contrast MRI brain images. The basic idea of this technique is to partition the input image histogram into two subhistograms based on a threshold which is obtained using Otsu's optimality principle. Then, bicriteria optimization problem is formulated to satisfy the aforementioned requirements. The subhistograms are modified by selecting optimal contrast enhancement parameters. Finally, the union of the modified subhistograms produce a contrast enhanced and details preserved output image. While developing an optimization problem, real coded genetic algorithm is applied to determine the optimal value of contrast enhancement parameters. This mechanism enhances the contrast of the input image better than the existing contemporary HE methods. The quality of the enhanced brain image indicates that the image obtained after this method can be useful for efficient detection of brain cancer in further process like segmentation, classification, etc. The performance of the proposed method is well supported by the contrast enhancement quantitative metrics such as discrete entropy and natural image quality evaluator. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These images form large-scale, high-dimensional data sets. Due to the fact that significant correlations exist among these images, we assume low-dimensional geometry data structures (manifolds) are embedded in the high-dimensional space. Those manifolds might be hidden from radiologists because it is challenging for human experts to interpret high-dimensional data. Identification of the manifold is a critical step for successfully analyzing multimodal MR images. We have developed various manifold learning algorithms (Tran et al. 2011; Tran et al. 2013) for medical image analysis. This paper presents a comparative study of an incremental manifold learning scheme (Tran. et al. 2013) versus the deep learning model (Hinton et al. 2006) in the application of brain tumor progression prediction. The incremental manifold learning is a variant of manifold learning algorithm to handle large-scale datasets in which a representative subset of original data is sampled first to construct a manifold skeleton and remaining data points are then inserted into the skeleton by following their local geometry. The incremental manifold learning algorithm aims at mitigating the computational burden associated with traditional manifold learning methods for large-scale datasets. Deep learning is a recently developed multilayer perceptron model that has achieved start-of-the-art performances in many applications. A recent technique named \"Dropout\" can further boost the deep model by preventing weight coadaptation to avoid over-fitting (Hinton et al. 2012). We applied the two models on multiple MRI scans from four brain tumor patients to predict tumor progression and compared the performances of the two models in terms of average prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision. The quantitative performance metrics were calculated as average over the four patients. Experimental results show that both the manifold learning and deep neural network models produced better results compared to using raw data and principle component analysis (PCA), and the deep learning model is a better method than manifold learning on this data set. The averaged sensitivity and specificity by deep learning are comparable with these by the manifold learning approach while its precision is considerably higher. This means that the predicted abnormal points by deep learning are more likely to correspond to the actual progression region.","authors":[{"name":"Deqi  Zhou","ids":["2112224461"]},{"name":"Loc  Tran","ids":["144029401"]},{"name":"Jihong  Wang","ids":["114017751"]},{"name":"Jiang  Li","ids":["2118505958"]}],"inCitations":["7d4fa817c20b36ad87e2abf7bf9aa232621b6c6b","76444b1a166f41d437fa5ed443244acc518e7d6c"],"outCitations":["523c8243e2933e0c0ee28150273c59f14d19fb22","8140bfb6737cb8e324a44488e1e12d5359c1a77a","afcd6da7637ddeef6715109aca248da7a24b1c65","46eb79e5eec8a4e2b2f5652b66441e8a4c921c3e","ac43625772e994b5265e5c6c1961de58ac3d6014","57f3433ab26040916c7ed2f19f2b6244cc4ac52a","531e2945f48cfa564e2c85c34d115aceb7214f05","1366de5bb112746a555e9c0cd00de3ad8628aea8","97474c55c834584b71f006557aed70e09eb6eb47","349bb07ab704a62683fbcc4b1c093daec2f8b563","92c72991158516d533c9fcd03a9790be7f7ccc8e","927326ae1ff22dc3157602a118cf029ebabe23eb","ffd3b0e43f7c500548b5b18cbbd2d089d933e92e","4b6ac8d87605f07e024208147b8d3159a798f8b8","184ac0766262312ba76bbdece4e7ffad0aa8180b","8fbb9b21564fee18ddf38c3ede54f22ecd99d383","24edcd7e8777160be45f0d2ba9058edbf7164713"],"year":2015,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ebc9aa4b86387737797c48eec055fe8cf7a89e5a","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2082645"],"venue":"Electronic Imaging","journalName":"","journalVolume":"9399","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1117/12.2082645","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2082645","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Engineering"],"magId":"2077276705","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"f70149a76fdce3d4124ee9b7d12dee446e28f098","title":"Computational intelligence in biomedical imaging: multidimensional analysis of spatio-temporal patterns","paperAbstract":"Technical innovations in radiology, such as advanced cross-sectional imaging methods, have opened up new vistas for the exploration of structure and function of the human body enabling both high spatial and temporal resolution. However, these techniques have led to vast amounts of data whose precise and reliable visual analysis by radiologists requires a considerable amount of human intervention and expertise, thus resulting in a cost factor of substantial economic relevance. Hence, the computer-assisted analysis of biomedical image data has moved into the focus of interest as an issue of high priority research efforts. In this context, innovative approaches to exploratory analysis of huge complex spatio-temporal patterns play a key role to improve computer-assisted signal and image processing in radiology. Examples of such approaches are various unsupervised vector quantization methods or supervised function approximation techniques, such as Generalized Radial-Basis-Functions- (GRBF-) neural networks. Recent developments motivated by concepts of computational intelligence are the ‘Deformable Feature Map’ (DM) as an algorithm for self-organized model adaptation, the ‘Mutual Connectivity Analysis’ (MCA) as an instrument for the analysis of large time-series ensembles and the ‘Exploratory Observation Machine’ (XOM) as a novel general framework for learning by self-organization—three methods that the author has invented and applied to biomedical real-world applications. This contribution covers both conceptual foundations and applications of such methods for pattern recognition and analysis to a wide scope of radiological data sets, such as structural and functional segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), ranging from functional MRI for human brain mapping to the monitoring of disease progression in multiple sclerosis by automatic lesion segmentation, as well as novel approaches to image time-series analysis in MRI mammography for breast cancer diagnosis.

Elastography","paperAbstract":"Dispersive material properties provide valuable metrics for characterizing the nature of soft tissue lesions. Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) targets non-invasive breast cancer diagnosis and is capable of imaging the damping properties of soft tissue. 3D time-harmonic displacement data obtained via MRI is used to drive a reconstruction algorithm capable of deducing the distribution of mechanical properties in the tissue. To make the most of this diagnostic capability, characterization of the damping behavior of tissue is made more sophisticated by the use of a Rayleigh damping model. To date, time-harmonic motion attenuation in tissue as found in dynamic MRE has been characterized by a single parameter model that takes the form of an imaginary component of a complex valued shear modulus. A more generalized damping formulation for the time-harmonic case, known commonly as Rayleigh or proportional damping, includes an additional parameter that takes the form of an imaginary component of a complex valued density. The effects of these two different damping mechanisms can be shown to be independent across homogeneous distributions and mischaracterization of the damping structure can be shown to lead to artifacts in the reconstructed attenuation profile. We have implemented a Rayleigh damping reconstruction method for MRE and measured the dispersive properties of actual patient data sets with impressive results. Reconstructions show a close match with varying tissue structure. The reconstructed values for real shear modulus and overall damping levels are in reasonable agreement with values established in the literature or measured by mechanical testing, and in the case of malignant lesions, show good correspondence with contrast enhanced MRI. There is significant medical potential for an algorithm that can accurately reconstruct soft tissue material properties through non invasive MRI scans. Imaging methods that help identify invasive regions through reconstruction of dispersive soft tissue properties could be applied to pathologies in the brain, lung, liver and kidney as well.© 2009 ASME","authors":[{"name":"D.

However, these techniques have led to vast amounts of data whose precise and reliable visual analysis by radiologists requires a considerable amount of human intervention and expertise, thus resulting in a cost factor of substantial economic relevance. Hence, the computer-assisted analysis of biomedical image data has moved into the focus of interest as an issue of high priority research efforts. In this context, innovative approaches to exploratory analysis of huge complex spatio-temporal patterns play a key role to improve computer-assisted signal and image processing in radiology. Examples of such approaches are various un-supervised vector quantization methods or supervised function approximation techniques, such as Generalized Radial-Basis-Functions- (GRBF-) neural networks. Recent developments motivated by concepts of computational intelligence are the 'Deformable Feature Map' (DM) as an algorithm for self-organized model adaptation, the 'Mutual Connectivity Analysis' (MCA) as an instrument for the analysis of large time-series ensembles and the 'Exploratory Observation Machine' (XOM) as a novel general framework for learning by self—organization—three methods that the author has invented and applied to biomedical real-world applications. This contribution covers both conceptual foundations and applications of such methods for pattern recognition and analysis to a wide scope of radiological data sets, such as structural and functional segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), ranging from functional MRI for human brain mapping to the monitoring of disease progression in multiple sclerosis by automatic lesion segmentation, as well as novel approaches to image time-series analysis in MRI mammography for breast cancer diagnosis.

MRI contrast agents are often administered to enhance the image contrast between normal and diseased tissues because of their ability to shorten the relaxation time of the surrounding water molecules. Paramagnetic gadolinium-based metal chelates have predominantly been using as T1 MRI contrast agents in clinic. There is another class of MRI contrast agents, superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIOs), which, instead of altering T1, have dominant effect on decreasing the transverse relaxation time (T2) (1). In contrast to the T1 contrast agents that generate brighter signals, SPIOs produce darker signals, so called negative contrast. However, SPIOs have much higher molar relaxivity and are thus widely used for molecular MRI applications such as cell tracking and molecular targeting (2,3). SPIO nanoparticles that comprise mainly magnetite, the ferric form of iron oxide, can be synthesized with high uniformity in size at varied diameters or lengths. Intriguingly, some microbes are found to have innate ability to synthesize magnetite to form specific intracellular organelles, the magnetosomes (4). Among these microbes, magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), a group of Gram-negative bacteria have been extensively studied. The MTB magnetosome is composed of a protein-rich lipid bilayer membrane and the enclosed crystals of magnetic iron oxides (5). Individual magnetosomes are aligned in a linear chain by attaching to a cytoskeletal filament, which allow the bacterial to navigate along the geomagnetic field. The size of magnetosomes is highly uniform but varies between species. Genomic analysis of MTBs has identified a number of genes that are highly likely to be involved in regulation of magnetosome biosynthesis. These genes are responsible for encoding various membrane proteins that are essential to either maintain the structural integrity or transport iron, the building blocks of magnetosome (6,7). Attracted by its paramagnetic property, researchers have been exploring the potential of magnetosomes as useful MRI contrast agents (8). Isolation and purification of magnetosomes from bacteria have previously been studied in terms of their paramagnetic relaxivity (9). In the March 2017 issue of Biomaterials, Boucher et al. have taken a further step to develop genetically modified magnetosomes with surface expression of RGD peptides, which enables MRI to monitor their specific targeting to αvβ3 integrins-overexpressing brain tumors in a mouse model of glioma (10). This study utilizes the gene construct of MamC that is known to associate with magnetosome production in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 strain. Genetic fusion of MamC with the RGD sequence and a yellow fluorescence reporter gene enables the AMB1 strain to express RGD peptides at the outer surface of magnetosomes. The RGD-magnetosomes purified from the bacterial present a uniform size of 40 nm.

Apart from standard neurosurgical indications (i.e., acoustic neurinomas, meningiomas, brain metastases, etc.) radiosurgical applications are currently evolving to include extracranial indications such as tumors of the spine, pancreas, lung, and liver. We reviewed the indications and outcomes in the first 1,000 patients treated in the CyberKnife Center Munich. Single-dose treatment was chosen because published clinical studies have demonstrated high efficacy and low morbidity for intracranial and spinal tumors. A recent development in radiosurgery is breathing-triggered real-time correction for respiratory motion of tumors, which makes it possible to apply radiosurgical doses to moving targets. CyberKnife treatment is designed to be delivered on an outpatient basis, mostly consisting of a single treatment session lasting between 60 and 90 min. High quality imaging is of utmost importance for successful radiosurgical applications. For example, high-field MRI, multislice CT’s, PET and PET-CT imaging data must be integrated in the planning phase for optimal target definition.ResultsA total of 750 patients with brain tumors were treated at the CyberKnife Center Munich in cooperation with the Department of Neurosurgery of the University Munich. A total of 285 patients with brain metastases received 339 treatments for 780 brain metastases. The first 55 spinal tumor patients were analyzed and have a mean follow-up of 14 months (out of 200 spinal tumor patients treated at our facility). Efficacy was high and complications minimal for all patient groups.ConclusionCyberKnife radiosurgery technology may be used as a primary treatment modality or in multidisciplinary cancer therapy. Patient selection, high quality diagnostic imaging and consideration of alternative modes of therapy are key issues in optimizing the benefits of CyberKnife treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander  Muacevic","ids":["1904411"]},{"name":"Berndt  Wowra","ids":["3230359"]},{"name":"Maximilian  Reiser","ids":["145371653"]}],"inCitations":["bffb2d370ebc9915a141c51de8ef33b93f441a3b","d437882d9de795cb2e65f79e60648fffd9912cb4","d9123e4e79cbaca6b6e25074c4b2af83438391c8","2f44755883ce5d6e8ba2122a5e89374fffc8d62a"],"outCitations":["f7ebcbe949d426b2e4501dff3035bc7c6e829814","06c0f4f0734f07a8e8cde8ff722a6bb73f5f7dc3","8c3d8b204af4236f8d03e1193c5e90565f50ad26","4403b40406b37d5f044c35e9ec6cd681e11d3612","78e6a2864cfbf0671ad956c8bc5194ec3364ca68","899ab6f7fbc285c014114a838305cd8b6d6341fb","55d9935f9e4ee1204e044b600d5300b45448c586","f6ec98126f4bd844661192db80394924fff3ea59","46fd3d47766da3ef73fac3ac88c60a1a3d52ce3a","ab8c79828d81c4fbcd2ddd0018b300af14ad3c1f","866d03863923bcffdb728e7c8b806839f607ff19","517f46f63ee9bb9c898fa2e6bda1e400caa993e3","6f45ec247d1837de47026b79cc666628dac75c19","4121e537b091648208bf9292962c0d15a3125acb","4e8d670587ffcc476035138c9c078e92074088f3","825560d6d726f7a1108778d16241959fb4b9ff74","df6751a84978310a070feed1058fe2f9407a5840","2705aab0c74cddf23a3ee2a061adc4837dfa5e69","fdfefc7348cc3bac72e65a1291024736f64dfb67","34a75851a43258a57ad791f783939bd7c67a4c6c","3d95e0e607de0708ffc670f9fc5a8cb1514fdf8d","8da61946b789d7d0ec65b01596d710326f9eb7d1","54538841bf2310b9ca350e9eea1d4f28cb1f9302","bce240e9837f686002757bf3c6dfcee4c7f126e8","a5a0da10c765d679e4e40fbc8b76ec25fce18486","00aae61f6bb6191b7087d88f7eaf6fd52ecff741","0baa3f8d74f6178c56d33cb9393c07858d39120e","bbd65c87a036b0c15595cd24959b40857e0e17b3","d117792dcaa695e058605415dcd55646fcc9e0d6"],"year":2008,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dfd29de761b6948372adf53a9d229c936e198f2c","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-008-0246-1"],"venue":"International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","journalName":"International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","journalVolume":"3","journalPages":"447-456","doi":"10.1007/s11548-008-0246-1","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-008-0246-1","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2096970980","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"d54746730d1adb957b5b809a08212168ef1c8345","title":"Generating synthetic CTs from magnetic resonance images using generative adversarial networks","paperAbstract":"PURPOSE\nWhile MR-only treatment planning using synthetic CTs (synCTs) offers potential for streamlining clinical workflow, a need exists for an efficient and automated synCT generation in the brain to facilitate near real-time MR-only planning. This work describes a novel method for generating brain synCTs based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), a deep learning model that trains two competing networks simultaneously, and compares it to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN).\n\n\nMETHODS\nPost-Gadolinium T1-Weighted and CT-SIM images from fifteen brain cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed. The GAN model was developed to generate synCTs using T1-weighted MRI images as the input using a residual network (ResNet) as the generator. The discriminator is a CNN with five convolutional layers that classified the input image as real or synthetic. Fivefold cross-validation was performed to validate our model. GAN performance was compared to CNN based on mean absolute error (MAE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics between the synCT and CT images.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGAN training took ~11 h with a new case testing time of 5.7 ± 0.6 s. For GAN, MAEs between synCT and CT-SIM were 89.3 ± 10.3 Hounsfield units (HU) and 41.9 ± 8.6 HU across the entire FOV and tissues, respectively. However, MAE in the bone and air was, on average, ~240-255 HU. By comparison, the CNN model had an average full FOV MAE of 102.4 ± 11.1 HU. For GAN, the mean PSNR was 26.6 ± 1.2 and SSIM was 0.83 ± 0.03. GAN synCTs preserved details better than CNN, and regions of abnormal anatomy were well represented on GAN synCTs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe developed and validated a GAN model using a single T1-weighted MR image as the input that generates robust, high quality synCTs in seconds. Our method offers strong potential for supporting near real-time MR-only treatment planning in the brain.","authors":[{"name":"Hajar  Emami","ids":["71134752"]},{"name":"Ming

imaging; Methods for CEST MRI","paperAbstract":"Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) is a\nrelatively new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition\ntechnique that generates contrast dependent on tissue\nmicroenvironment, such as protein concentration and intracellular\npH. CEST imaging has the potential to become an important biomarker\nin a wide range of disorders. As an indicator of tissue pH, CEST\nimaging may allow the identification of the ischemic penumbra in\nstroke, and predict chemo- and radiation therapy outcomes in\ncancer. As a marker of protein concentration, CEST may be able to\ndelineate tumor margins without contrast enhancement, identify\ndisease onset in Alzheimer's disease, and monitor cartilage repair\ntherapies. Despite several promising pilot studies, CEST imaging\nhas had limited clinical application due to two main technical\nchallenges. First, CEST imaging is extremely sensitive to magnetic\nfield inhomogeneity. Images suffer from large susceptibility\nartifacts unless specialized BO inhomogeneity correction methods\nare employed that tremendously increase scan time. Second, the CEST\ncontrast cannot be separated from the intrinsic macromolecular\nmagnetization transfer (MT) asymmetry and brain images reflect the\nMT properties of white and gray matter rather than the desired\nprotein and pH contrast. We have developed a novel CEST imaging\nacquisition scheme, dubbed saturation with frequency alternating RF\nirradiation (SAFARI), designed to be insensitive to Bo\ninhomogeneity and MT asymmetry. Studies in healthy volunteers\ndemonstrate that SAFARI is robust in the presence of BO\ninhomogeneity and eliminates the need for specialized BO\ncorrection, thereby reducing scan time. In addition, results show\nthat SAFARI removes the confounding MT asymmetry. We applied SAFARI\nimaging towards the study of the saturation transfer contrast in\npatients with high grade glioma. Results show that the contrast in\nbrain tumors, which was previously attributed to an increase in the\nCEST signal from amide protons due to an elevated protein\nconcentration, is instead the result of the loss of MT asymmetry\nfound in the normal brain. Therefore, our work has lead to a new\nunderstanding of the different sources of signal in saturation\ntransfer images of the brain with important implications for the\ndesign and analysis of future CEST studies of brain\ntumors.","authors":[{"name":"Rachel Nora Scheidegger","ids":["21236594"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2013,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c9d7e2f6406a2cbd9da503afc77d9f4606db2d00","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"2952859335","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"8ea4e30092e6b8d88a3b976d846c644cb4b25a83","title":"Saliency Based Deep Neural Network for Automatic Detection of Gadolinium-Enhancing Multiple Sclerosis Lesions in Brain MRI","paperAbstract":"The appearance of contrast-enhanced pathologies (e.g. lesion, cancer) is an important marker of disease activity, stage and treatment efficacy in clinical trials. The automatic detection and segmentation of these enhanced pathologies remains a difficult challenge, as they can be very small and visibly similar to other non-pathological enhancements (e.g. blood vessels). In this paper, we propose a deep neural network classifier for the detection and segmentation of Gadolinium enhancing lesions in brain MRI of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To avoid false positive and false negative assertions, the proposed end-to-end network uses an enhancement-based attention mechanism which assigns saliency based on the differences between the T1-weighted images before and after injection of Gadolinium, and works to first identify candidate lesions and then to remove the false positives. The effect of the saliency map is evaluated on 2293 patient multi-channel MRI scans acquired during two proprietary, multi-center clinical trials for MS treatments. Inclusion of the attention mechanism results in a decrease in false positive lesion voxels over a basic U-Net [2] and DeepMedic [6]. In terms of lesion-level detection, the framework achieves a sensitivity of 82% at a false discovery rate of 0.2, significantly outperforming the other two methods when detecting small lesions. Experiments aimed at predicting the presence of Gad lesion activity in patient scans (i.e. the presence of more than 1 lesion) result in high accuracy showing: (a) significantly improved accuracy over DeepMedic, and (b) a reduction in the errors in predicting the degree of lesion activity (in terms of per scan lesion counts) over a standard U-Net and DeepMedic.","authors":[{"name":"Joshua  Durso-Finley","ids":["1707936879"]},{"name":"Douglas L.

Regarding the information transmission, wireless capsule endoscopy has already been used in our daily life. Wearable or implantable monitoring systems including RFID (radio frequency identification) tags have widely been investigated and reported. As for diagnosis, antenna technology is indispensable to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or fMRI systems. Microwave CT (computed tomography) or radiometry will be another promising technique for noninvasive diagnosis. Thirdly, heat generated by radiation from antennas has been used for treatment. Hyperthermia and coagulation are typical thermal therapies for cancer treatment. In this presentation, three different types of antennas which have been studied in our laboratory are introduced. Firstly, a pretty small antenna for an implantable monitoring system is presented. An H-shaped cavity slot antenna is a candidate for such a system. Some numerical and experimental characteristics of the antenna are demonstrated. Secondly, some different antennas or \"RF coils\" for MRI systems are introduced. In addition, SAR (specific absorption rate) distributions in the abdomen of a pregnant woman generated in a bird cage coil are illustrated. Finally, after a brief overview of thermal therapy and microwave heating, coaxial-slot antennas and array applicators composed of several coaxial-slot antennas for minimally invasive microwave thermal therapies are introduced. Then a few results of actual clinical trials by use of the coaxial-slot antennas are demonstrated from a technical point of view. Other therapeutic applications of the coaxial-slot antennas such as hyperthermic treatment for brain tumor and intracavitary hyperthermia for bile duct carcinoma are introduced.

Changes in cell size and shape discriminate functional areas in the brain and can highlight different degrees of malignancy in cancer tumours. Consequently various methods have emerged recently that aim to measure the microscopic anisotropy of porous media such as biological tissue and aim to reflect pore eccentricity, the simplest shape feature. However, current methods assume a substrate of identical pores, and are strongly influenced by non-trivial size distribution. This paper presents a model-based approach that provides estimates of pore size and shape from diffusion MRI data. The technique uses a geometric model of randomly oriented finite cylinders with gamma distributed radii. We use Monte Carlo simulation to generate synthetic data in substrates consisting of randomly oriented cuboids with various size distributions and eccentricities. We compare the sensitivity of single and double pulsed field gradient (sPFG and dPFG) sequences to the size distribution and eccentricity and further compare different protocols of dPFG sequences with parallel and/or perpendicular pairs of gradients. The key result demonstrates that this model-based approach can provide features of pore shape (specifically eccentricity) that are independent of the size distribution unlike previous attempts to characterise microscopic anisotropy. We show further that explicitly accounting for size distribution is necessary for accurate estimates of average size and eccentricity, and a model that assumes a single size fails to recover the ground truth values. We find the most accurate parameter estimates for dPFG sequences with mixed parallel and perpendicular gradients, nevertheless all other sequences, including sPFG, show sensitivity as well.","authors":[{"name":"Andrada  Ianus","ids":["2476044"]},{"name":"Ivana  Drobnjak","ids":["2431102"]},{"name":"Daniel C.

The first-principles calculation indicates that it is nearly impossible for toxic Gd ions to dissociate freely from silica. The biocompatibility studies confirm that the nanocomposite is lack of any potential toxicity; the biodistribution studies reveal a greater accumulation of the nanocomposite in liver, spleen, lung and tumor than in kidney, heart and brain; the excretion studies show that the nanocomposite can be cleared nearly 50% via the hepatobiliary transport mechanism after 1.5 months of injection. A larger water proton relaxivity r(1) and a better T(1)-weighted phantom MR imaging capability were detected in the nanocomposite than in the commercially available gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate. The results demonstrate that the nanocomposite is superior to the commercial counterpart in terms of contrast enhancement with a satisfactory biocompatibility, and it has a high potential to be developed into a safe and effective targeted probe for in vivo molecular imaging of cancer.","authors":[{"name":"Yuanzhi  Shao","ids":["2217234"]},{"name":"Xiumei

In the healthcare domain, these will allow for more significant opportunities for personalized medicine and health monitoring solutions that will be directly connected to a health-care provider where patient data will be analyzed. Optimally, a model fitted to local data could be shared between providers to benefit from data that is not available locally, whether to debias a model or to gain better insight on a rarely seen condition. Since patient data privacy is of utmost importance, we require a method for transferring knowledge from sources containing data of interest without exposing or sharing local data. We propose such a method based on knowledge distillation that can transfer knowledge between models in real-time. Our approach results in lower training and converging time in addition to the ability to classify targets that are rarely or never seen locally accurately. Our method emphasizes transferring knowledge without sacrificing the insights gained from local data. We show our method works on skin cancer classification, detecting tumors in brain MRI scans, and other image datasets.

The RF interstitial hyperthermia treatment is an effective low-invasive cancer treatment. However, this treatment requires high technique from medical doctors to insert the needle applicator inside the tumor. Since the skull protects the human brain, including complicated nerves, blood vessels and important tissues, a VR support system for training and making an effective surgery plan is needed in clinics. In this paper, first, we constructed an anatomical 3-D model from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) images by using 3-D computer aided design (CAD) software. Second, we demonstrated the VR system consisting of a hand-tracking sensor. Finally, we calculated temperature distributions using the 3-D FEM model with a needle applicator displayed in a developed VR system. Finally, for evaluating the developed VR system, we compared the estimated result to experimented result using agar phantom. From these results, it was found that the proposed VR system is effective for performing hyperthermia treatments.","authors":[{"name":"Yasuhiro  Shindo","ids":["48280300"]},{"name":"Kazuo  Kato","ids":["2110055812"]}],"inCitations":["8b7bdcc1cbd60a9ed99f700788ca45e28875c6d3"],"outCitations":["64d6fc590d62e0b8b8f75c31dd2458220704aa54","7eccccd2039c4665ec6e0378e8c1da26b0b954bd","0d8c35cb0d9e68984c5c2b71d3401f88d64050d8","a744270ed14e626326232e9460ba1a61458e6c71","db292ae75adabc0094cd6fe66080c972804fd015","05afe6bf9f3d9c82d37516017083286922de7128","c0f2015fa889f7bd40aef3d4941ba2881936286b","ec80f899a8d122f2c31be26b757800b75cf078cc","a44bb6fce4cadcd47d8cbe1c6dd5b92f9535bc13","fed9963be2704e0841385a08638df1647ca0525c"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7338e81432b22daad056c35e31fa27f398275f6a","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2019.8927160"],"venue":"IECON 2019 - 45th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","journalName":"IECON 2019 - 45th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","journalVolume":"1","journalPages":"6961-6965","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2019.8927160","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2019.8927160","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2995634370","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"09d8d90dbcba31a67ac7a657e47c77071680f8d6","title":"A Framework for Multimodal Imaging Biomarker Extraction with Application to Brain MRI","paperAbstract":"The crucial role of imaging biomarkers is sparsely mentioned in the literature due to the complex nature of medical images, the interpretation variability and the multidisciplinary approach needed to extract, validate, and translate such biomarkers to the clinical setting. In the case of cancer, imaging biomarkers can play an important role in understanding the stage of the disease as well as the response (or not) to initial treatment as early as possible. In neurodegenerative diseases, imaging biomarkers can assist the early detection and diagnosis, before substantial symptoms appear. In this chapter, we describe the clinical importance of establishing robust imaging biomarkers as well as the limitations that need to be addressed. Then, we propose a clinically driven/ assisted image-analysis-based framework for extracting and assessing temporal image biomarkers comprising of geometrical normalization and image-information extraction. The proposed biomarker image discovery framework including a number of clinically useful tools developed by our group has been integrated in a platform called ‘DoctorEye’, a novel, open access and easy to use clinical multimodal image analysis environment. Based on this clinical platform, we describe three examples of imaging biomarker discovery involving our recent work for the case of brain MRI.","authors":[{"name":"Kostas  Marias","ids":["2629216"]},{"name":"Vangelis  Sakkalis","ids":["3200755"]},{"name":"Norbert  Graf","ids":["31710426"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["6818668fb895d95861a2eb9673ddc3a41e27b3b3","4114c7cb6c8ebf7987c1ff536e1d2f81c3d04238","87c271f6e308f9650e5e6f963ab24661ed4070ba","a50b3f64d2bf42794e8652afd8e22dd86d205f27","4bd236cc67b0dd67730737dae00fee0dc331344b","55af5cd1eac2b7aeb777bb6c354e1ff5aa68eac5","496c3d75b81b336411e53da1ac632a8139655604","9394a5d5adcb626128b6a42c8810b9505a3c6487","36393fa434bd4c2ac6c77b167c25b2fe04c26448","a5d4ced8fa034d4f6bcdd4f44bc2c4bd987cbfb2","68813e366c5127b7ff2e6753f9ce0963cbf97ee9","186050bcbecc5a8f2caa76ae9d283bd7bb2c283d","77a1ca2df0871df21f85c2c2ca110946e350cfa5","5ec92913d6fd750871728b956f7c23e792d44ceb","a7d731ccc3a83e9567734265ddd41bb377286c17","ed9855f5404b9c792f8b5bacd4bd93c2b6a323aa","eb994dc7b585b491e0b2814b9c41734a99570732","788b629f13f12801dadf2988a861ac5ec3ad480f","695b0daa280e9d8cb13e543930dafabb553ceadd","c0c8ce3d373c247a4b58b223210c957298ba0227","95c4c21f580db269ee81e18143de781771061661","688af381cfb43a387abd961d986f9a497f224be7","02b05bf88870c4d1ff42ce65cf39f32349ea5642","986e02e53321369a3f347fd1fe73f480aeee421d","508e625cd8cfb8ed9d6ac49e68b853d8f6d70741","24efcce00db9e095136d4dece61dda8fe36c51b8","fcf8e7640ad0a5f1c6133b24738db4909857851d","a2d0bbc152e935962416c727139b2255b00c4153"],"year":2012,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/09d8d90dbcba31a67ac7a657e47c77071680f8d6","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"91-116","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4614-2107-8_6","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-2107-8_6","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"69996460","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"e1ffe48575b085cc0528d930e346d5690edb4bd8","title":"Enhanced Monomodal Image Registration Process With Cuckoo Search Algorithm","paperAbstract":"Medical image registration is one of the processes involved in medical image analysis. During the process, an image will be computed and transform it for mapping the reference image to the target image to analyze the similarity merits as to help in diagnosis the situation in the medical field. However, the accuracy of the image registration is in question, might be improved if we can make use some optimization during the image registration process. In this research, we propose an enhancement of image registration algorithms based on monomodal registration by incorporating Cuckoo Search (CS) method for Levy flight generation while simultaneously modifying and optimizing it to work on MRI image scanners, specifically to detect brain cancer. The performance of the proposed monomodal registration with CS algorithm was compared with basic traditional monomodal registration. The experimental results were validated by measuring the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and CPU run-time for all cases investigated. Our results show that the proposed monomodal registration with CS algorithm achieved the best 2% improved in NMI results and 42% reduced in CPU run-time. The method evolved to be more promising and computationally efficient for medical image registration.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Syafiq Md Roslan","ids":["2071047168"]},{"name":"Nor Azizah Ali","ids":["144846703"]},{"name":"Nor Haizan Mohd Radzi","ids":["3435177"]},{"name":"Muhalim Mohamed Amin","ids":["1382288067"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["8ff824d7352aeadd4a83fa8f6cabf7ebb9195155","a40384013f0dcb8174353dafad44a97f49c03759","bc233416d567d37b345ec916d6b50f96bd73bad6","83591aaac2db7c52e1705475ce344ab66706c619","2dfcfe81dfb7afa5a9d2b4c9fc28b4e61f6cbcaf","eeb18a23646fa04988912a25afc136ce2f45cdc6"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1ffe48575b085cc0528d930e346d5690edb4bd8","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"864","journalPages":"012051","doi":"10.1088/1757-899x/864/1/012051","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x%2F864%2F1%2F012051","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3041445209","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"5441e34e60403847a33353f83efacc9251d9864a","title":"Gas-phase production of multifunctional composite nanoparticles by photoinduced chemical vapor deposition","paperAbstract":"Nano-scale materials and devices allow for unique interactions that are not possible at larger scales. Magnetic particles below a critical size (∼10 nm) demonstrate distinctive behavior known as superparamagnetism, where particles do not exhibit any net magnetic force outside the presence of an external magnetic field. However, within an alternating magnetic field, as in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, superparamagnetic particles give off heat as a result of Brownian and Neelian relaxation. Heat produced by the shifting pole orientation can raise the temperature of the tissue sufficient to cause cell death through necrosis or apoptosis [1]. Additionally, combinations of electrically conductive and insulating materials within a single nanoparticle give rise to surface plasmon resonance. The resonance of the plasmon absorption can be tuned based on the relative thicknesses of the two layers. These particles can be used to thermally ablate cancer cells if the resonance is tuned to absorb light from an infrared laser. The penetrating ability of the nanoparticles combined with their capacity to kill cells make them excellent candidates for treatment of conditions such as brain tumors and prostate cancer.Copyright © 2010 by ASME","authors":[{"name":"Adam M.

It will enhance drug development and advance medical treatment, especially in cancer-related diseases. However, identifying the objects in the CT or MRI images and labeling them usually takes time even for an experienced person. Currently, there is no automatic detection technique for nucleus identification, pneumonia detection, and fetus brain segmentation. Fortunately, as the successful application of artificial intelligence (AI) in image processing, many challenging tasks are easily solved with deep convolutional neural networks. In light of this, in this thesis, the deep learning based object detection and segmentation methods were implemented to perform the nucleus segmentation, lung segmentation, pneumonia detection, and fetus brain segmentation. The semantic segmentation is achieved by the customized U-Net model, and the instance localization is achieved by Faster R-CNN. The reason we choose U-Net is that such a network can be trained end-to-end, which means the architecture of this network is very simple, straightforward and fast to train. Besides, for this project, the availability of the dataset is limited, which makes U-Net a more suitable choice. We also implemented the Faster R-CNN to achieve the object localization. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the two models and further compared the pros and cons of them. The preliminary results show that deep learning based technique outperforms all existing traditional segmentation algorithms.","authors":[{"name":"Liming  Wu","ids":["50789820"]}],"inCitations":["01c2fe7fb46f87e35ed54ebc3986da96927cb944","c34c0f430f8655981803c692a41f8318954d7a58"],"outCitations":["9c9d7247f8c51ec5a02b0d911d1d7b9e8160495d","6c7bdab6e39a6045f4700efb5b09a8c5e646e7c9","8b6b0c1139a3ab405e6df58aaa79305867f453ef","71c1ce0aae82d2f6f70d0c3129a4352076abef8a","424561d8585ff8ebce7d5d07de8dbf7aae5e7270","b0aca3e7877c3c20958b0fae5cbf2dd602104859","cec734d7097ab6b1e60d95228ffd64248eb89d66","053e5d866889384911ca8778a2ad484bebafd0ca","83dfe3980b875c4e5fe6f2cb1df131cc46d175c8","20b844e395355b40fa5940c61362ec40e56027aa","73668900aed3b7674a21fd7734f726151136a06e","9f2ed47224b9424375aff70f9377317d4eb2a9a0","7ffdbc358b63378f07311e883dddacc9faeeaf4b","62ed272e0e8b7be356c7f7595f5b7a22797a1c3e","04b23f577c20d1a0e2a67aadda555f58e6d23d6e","95ace8012614bf7cc316af9863263c8453d3ba81","abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff","fbc6562814e08e416e28a268ce7beeaa3d0708c8","1554931d9ce2f18e5515b24601c3f18ebe76c80d","c2a1d466a3754400c78f49fcda67767ef596d12f","111fd833a4ae576cfdbb27d87d2f8fc0640af355","f1b962fb4070fedd46758e334db3ba4f00ddc3ec","2f4df08d9072fc2ac181b7fced6a245315ce05c8","a058935fd019c2367fd32c16cd1ce6983a29aafb","a6364c7d9b6fd35a3e32b4a4527d7294489e90e3","a934d496a1daae7556b1a65e0c95496c5f71836e","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","842b62ab334def5b425b884fbc2a5bf09e31b3cc","ab7c6fcfeef3b2632f211d5213e6ee947360c5fc","4f8d648c52edf74e41b0996128aa536e13cc7e82","242d22cfbc6a2715f71996b8faeaa69cf1685a14","4dc8ae35f24a8623282dbf767b93473c41cd2ec3","eed8cb35e2d08be9e595a151a4c796f872eba056","a7e83ff1c525e565dd8630616e7a9d7579a953ff","54e325aee6b2d476bbbb88615ac15e251c6e8214","be0c539bec5c2d379ab1884e61a5bb8ccb91dc30","aa7bfd2304201afbb19971ebde87b17e40242e91","77f0a39b8e02686fd85b01971f8feb7f60971f80","5fdee881177c55d51ea5c0152adc082a034369af","79cfb51a51fc093f66aac8e858afe2e14d4a1f20","cbb19236820a96038d000dc629225d36e0b6294a","4d7a9197433acbfb24ef0e9d0f33ed1699e4a5b0","6d03a38c5ddb7c7cd1ceb59b28907dc918c5d83a","69e68bfaadf2dccff800158749f5a50fe82d173b","aeeffe327e6c93e9010c7b1e401caa9113723851","839e3f306e6bba0b0cfa196f37487b032e9e0309","4f516307ed1f3b6de9e4bfc47c14f280ea58be43","3dbb621f1c35c659f3ce6efadad7aa16308fae13","b9b4e05faa194e5022edd9eb9dd07e3d675c2b36","52ca4ed04d1d9dba3e6ae30717898276735e0b79"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a45cc6e37fe0b394cff19b503a1ab6173119ff4c","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pstorage-purdue-258596361474/15006704/Liming_wu_thesis.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"10.25394/PGS.8051702.V1","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.25394/PGS.8051702.V1","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2951587949","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"998cb4609d177feaf5d0dc4b5d64b782236338f8","title":"Caracterisation of Dementia by 3D Analysis of Cerebral Structures","paperAbstract":"Dementia is one of the main health challenges facing our generation. It is the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer. Detection of dementia from neuroimaging data such as MRI through machine learning has been a subject of intense research in a recent year. Although many works of literatures have developed many approaches to characterize this disease and to classifier its stages automatically, currently there is no specific technique to confirm with certainty the diagnosis of dementia. Brain regions are important for prediction of dementia stages. Some of the researchers were focused on the segmentation of the grey matter, others are focused on the cortical thickness. This paper investigates how to characterize and to predict dementia stages from a 3D MR image Database. Data provided by OASIS BRAIN includes a cross-section of 175 subjects aged 60 to 96 years. The approach relies on many steps. It started with applying data preprocessing which includes registration and segmentation of the hippocampus with a Bayesian probabilistic approach based on the Markovian modeling. The second step is to extract some features from the hippocampus. Finally, the prediction of dementia stages is done with a supervised learning algorithm: Artificial Neural Network. The results evince that the proposed approach can be used to characterize and predict the stages of dementia with over 95% accuracy, considerably higher than that of conventional basic methods. This study confirms that to extract geometric descriptors from the hippocampus can effectively solve the dementia characterization problem.","authors":[{"name":"Nour El Houda Mezrioui","ids":["147688588"]},{"name":"Kamel  Aloui","ids":["48173005"]},{"name":"Mohamed Saber Naceur","ids":["1869865"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["d2484a45df7f56029fe8ddd286377eb21f420026","06767fd63b95f60902c7cba992cb0ac12a1372fb","6cc40ab3f59d8a14bb9bbf75e6b975ad870ebd80","193edd20cae92c6759c18ce93eeea96afd9528eb","5beb9713b7f6e3f8cf9844e28864bf710c62a94c","9bdd8ebb93cb64e188ac4c8d9f924511d9a6e6fb","c8d49d2daadccf6f50e8b0b3695a1d6062315ac4","786c8b7ff875b54cc2291e519df8150400e1e691","68362aac4506780f7a3dec8267bea3d715ac255b"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/998cb4609d177feaf5d0dc4b5d64b782236338f8","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2019 International Conference on Advanced Systems and Emergent Technologies (IC_ASET)","journalName":"2019 International Conference on Advanced Systems and Emergent Technologies (IC_ASET)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"300-303","doi":"10.1109/ASET.2019.8871017","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASET.2019.8871017","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2980653797","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"32df9e61d2090603dbed9bf6ba9e815de0564b27","title":"Advanced Signal Processing Methods for Biomedical Imaging","paperAbstract":"Signal processing is a long-established engineering field with broad applications in so different arenas such as multimedia (audio, still image, video, graphics, etc.), coding, communications, seismology, astronomy, biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and econometrics, to only name some of them. Signal processing stems from cross-fertilized grounds including mathematical analysis, algebra, numerical analysis, probability, statistics, information theory, discrete mathematics, cybernetics, and computer science. Advances in signal processing have frequently been pulled by needs in specific application domains, so that they are readily incorporated to the signal processing knowledge base for convenient use in distant areas of application. \n \nSignal and image processing is ubiquitous in modern biomedical imaging, as it provides essential techniques for image construction, enhancement, coding, storage, transmission, analysis, understanding, and visualization from any of an increasing number of different multidimensional sensing modalities. As biomedical imaging is rapidly evolving, new and more powerful signal and image processing algorithms are required to meet the challenges imposed by modern huge multidimensional multimodal biomedical data, particularly in real clinical settings. \n \nIn this special issue, we present high-quality original research papers that address specific challenges for the biomedical imaging community and benefit of advanced and emerging methods in signal and image processing required for novel time-varying high-dimensional structural and functional biomedical imaging modalities. Interesting new ideas from other fields of application of signal and image processing have been highly welcome since their practical relevance for biomedical imaging is clearly motivated. \n \nIn particular, this special issue features original research for different imaging modalities, such as generalized diffusion tensor imaging (GDTI), conventional diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), X-ray mammography and time-frequency representations (TFR) of electrophysiological data such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or local field potentials (LFP). The medical application areas include central nervous system fiber tractography, analysis of episodic memory and motor brain activity, analysis of neural activity patterns, and breast cancer screening and detection. As for the signal and image processing methods, a brief list of topics addressed in this special issue include higher-order tensors, signal estimation and classification, clustering, and multivariate statistics, to name a few. \n \nIn “Fast and analytical EAP approximation from a 4th-order tensor,” A. Ghosha and R. Deriche deal with the complicated problem of inferring the microstructure of tissue or fiber bundles from DW-MRI. To this extent they propose a modified GDTI approach, where the higher-Order tensor (HOT) representation of the apparent diffusivity coefficient (ADC) is estimated, from the DW-MRI data, in such a way that they provide a closed-form approximation, using Hermite polynomials, to the ensemble average propagator (EAP) that overcomes the computational overload of other EAP estimation methods from GDTI. The EAP describes the probability of the diffusing particles, and, hence, the geometry of the EAP is a direct indicator of the microstructure of the underlying tissue or fiber bundles. They provide experimental results on the fiber bundles estimated from real and synthetic brain datasets. \n \nIn “DCE-MRI and DWI integration for breast lesions assessment and heterogeneity quantification,” C. A. Mendez et al. address the quantification of breast tumor heterogeneity using jointly DW-MRI and DCE-MRI, which provide a measure of cellularity and an indication of blood volume, flow, and vascular permeability, respectively. To that end, they first make an affine followed by an elastic registration of both datasets and approach the tissue segmentation by clustering using a dissimilarity-based representation (DBR) of the DCE curves and the ADC maps, followed by K-means. Statistical testing is carried out for the ADC maps of the resulting clusters. They provide experimental results from 21 patients with primary ductal carcinoma. \n \nIn “The smoothing artifact of spatially constrained canonical correlation analysis in functional MRI,” D. Cordes et al. address the problem of the spatial specificity of the activation signal in fMRI due to smoothing artifacts that arise in an extension of the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) termed constrained CCA (cCCA), which is used as a statistic in fMRI to test for functional brain activation in a specific neighborhood. In particular, they investigate in detail the smoothing artifact that is associated with each spatial constraint in cCCA and provide a novel approach in order to correct the measure of activation for the smoothing artifact within a Bayesian testing framework. They also provide experimental results on six real cases with six normal subjects carrying out certain motor and episodic memory tasks. \n \nIn “A new GLLD operator for mass detection in digital mammograms,” N. Gargouri et al. propose an extension to the local binary pattern (LBP) operator used for texture classification in order to overcome some limitations that arise from the fact that LBP uses local gray-level differences. In particular they introduce the gray level and local Difference (GLLD) representation that, in addition to differences, also uses gray levels and investigate the efficiency of the GLLD-based approach as a method of feature extraction. They tackle the detection of abnormal masses on breast X-ray images by performing a manual region of interest (ROI) delineation, followed by the GLLD representation and standard classification by k-NN, support vector machines, and multilayer perceptrons. Experimental results are from 1000 ROIs from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography. \n \nLast but not least, in “A flexible model for feature extraction from brain signals in the time-frequency domain,” R. Heideklang and G. Ivanova provide a different perspective since they deal with electrophysiological data. Images arise from the time-frequency representation (TFR) of these nonstationary signals that are obtained in the paper from the smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution. A common problem of TFRs from electrophysiological data is inter- and intrasubject variability of the features to be extracted (curves in the TFR), which is here addressed by proposing the smooth natural Gaussian extension (snaGe) model, characterized by a sequence of multivariate Gaussians located on a parametric curve described by a cubic B-spline. By combining cubic B-splines with the Gaussian shape, they obtain a “sufficiently smooth model which inherits both the splines' flexibility and the Gaussian standard model's robustness.” In order to fit the model to the data, after subsampling, an initial estimation of the initial parameters of the curve is obtained by dynamic programming, which is refined through iteration, and using Frechet and other metrics for curve difference. The authors present results on real and synthetic EEG data, and they discuss the robustness and the sensitivity of the method to noise. \n \nWe hope that the readers enjoy this special issue. \n \n \nJuan Ruiz-Alzola \n \nCarlos Alberola-Lopez \n \nCarl-FredrikWestin","authors":[{"name":"Juan  Ruiz-Alzola","ids":["1398144366"]},{"name":"Carlos  Alberola-López","ids":["1393655585"]},{"name":"Carl-Fredrik  Westin","ids":["1744741"]}],"inCitations":["39c6b3297d514cefe2eda62cb457e846316a5cde"],"outCitations":[],"year":2013,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/32df9e61d2090603dbed9bf6ba9e815de0564b27","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11180465/3572641.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ijbi/2013/696878.pdf","https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11180465/3572641.pdf?sequence=1","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/59/8d/IJBI2013-696878.PMC3572641.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42107037"],"venue":"Int.

Currently, detection of transcriptomic subtype is based on ex vivo analysis of tissue that does not capture the spatial tumor heterogeneity. In view of accumulative evidence of in vivo imaging signatures summarizing molecular features of cancer, this study seeks robust non-invasive radiographic markers of transcriptomic classification of glioblastoma, based solely on routine clinically-acquired imaging sequences. A pre-operative retrospective cohort of 112 pathology-proven de novo glioblastoma patients, having multi-parametric MRI (T1, T1-Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR), collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were included. Following tumor segmentation into distinct radiographic sub-regions, diverse imaging features were extracted and support vector machines were employed to multivariately integrate these features and derive an imaging signature of transcriptomic subtype. Extracted features included intensity distributions, volume, morphology, statistics, tumors' anatomical location, and texture descriptors for each tumor sub-region. The derived signature was evaluated against the transcriptomic subtype of surgically-resected tissue specimens, using a 5-fold cross-validation method and a receiver-operating-characteristics analysis. The proposed model was 71% accurate in distinguishing among the four transcriptomic subtypes. The accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) for distinguishing each subtype (classical, mesenchymal, proneural, neural) from the rest was equal to 88.4% (71.4/92.3), 75.9% (83.9/72.8), 82.1% (73.1/84.9), and 75.9% (79.4/74.4), respectively. The findings were also replicated in The Cancer Genomic Atlas glioblastoma dataset. The obtained imaging signature for the classical subtype was dominated by associations with features related to edge sharpness, whereas for the mesenchymal subtype had more pronounced presence of higher T2 and T2-FLAIR signal in edema, and higher volume of enhancing tumor and edema. The proneural and neural subtypes were characterized by the lower T1-Gd signal in enhancing tumor and higher T2-FLAIR signal in edema, respectively. Our results indicate that quantitative multivariate analysis of features extracted from clinically-acquired MRI may provide a radiographic biomarker of the transcriptomic profile of glioblastoma. Importantly our findings can be influential in surgical decision-making, treatment planning, and assessment of inoperable tumors.","authors":[{"name":"Saima  Rathore","ids":["40484677"]},{"name":"Hamed  Akbari","ids":["1836349"]},{"name":"Spyridon  Bakas","ids":["3199900"]},{"name":"Jared M.

Molecular diagnostic of glioma using machine learning has grabbed attention to some extent from last couple of years. The development of molecular-level predictive approach carries great potential in radiogenomic field. But more focused efforts need to be put to develop such approaches. This study aims to develop an integrative genomic diagnostic method to assess the significant utility of textures combined with other radiographic and clinical features for IDH classification of glioma into IDH mutant and IDH wild type. Random forest classifier is used for classification of combined set of clinical features and radiographic features extracted from axial T2-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images of low- and high-grade glioma. Such radiogenomic analysis is performed on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data of 74 patients of IDH mutant and 104 patients of IDH wild type. Texture features are extracted using uniform, rotation invariant Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) method. Other features such as shape, first-order statistics, image contrast-based, clinical data like age, histologic grade are combined with LTP features for IDH discrimination. Proposed random forest-assisted model achieved an accuracy of 85.89% with multivariate analysis of integrated set of feature descriptors using Glioblastoma and Low-Grade Glioma dataset available with The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Such an integrated feature analysis using LTP textures and other descriptors can effectively predict molecular class of glioma as IDH mutant and wild type.","authors":[{"name":"Sonal  Gore","ids":["9741384"]},{"name":"Jayant  Jagtap","ids":["3453369"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2021,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d6115d4de5774dfa365b9f93ddc42387b6c3b7e4","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Image and Graphics","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"2140013","doi":"10.1142/S0219467821400131","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219467821400131","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"3135582505","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"943795db51c56b84fbf9d64fe30ba437481973bf","title":"The Role of Pattern Recognition in Computer-Aided Diagnosis and Computer-Aided Detection in Medical Imaging: A Clinical Validation","paperAbstract":"The idea to use texture analysis in medical imaging has been considered since the early 1970s. However, the exciting evolution of both texture analysis algorithms and computer technology revived researchers' interest in applications for medical imaging in recent years. Technical innovations in medical cross-sectional imaging have opened up new vistas for the exploration of the human body, enabling both high spatial and temporal resolution. On Difficulties Caused by Missing Reference Image Datasets One of the main problems in the development of systems for the analysis of medical images or segmentation algorithms is the set of images that is used for both the development and the testing of the system. This paper proposes a diagnostic scheme follows a familiar two-step approach. Initially, textural information is extracted from the image. Subsequently, the extracted information is fed into a decisional algorithm that is designed to perform the diagnostic task.The talk covers new methods for pattern recognition and computer-aided diagnosis in the field of MRI, such as functional MRI for human brain mapping, therapy control by automatic lesion detection in multiple sclerosis, and new approaches to breast cancer diagnosis in MRI mammography. In the light of such innovative techniques for pattern recognition in biomedicine, the increasing demand for publicly accessible validation platforms is emphasized. With image texture analysis in the role of the visual perceptional function, the process of feature extraction and image coding is achieved. The extracted features can now be merged into a diagnosis by using a decision-making algorithm, with choices that range from the rule-based models to the traditional statistical analysis to the more popular (and often more successful) artificial intelligence techniques, such as neural networks and genetic algorithms. By using image texture analysis as the preprocessing step in CAD schemes, the input generation process is automated and, therefore, is reproducible and robust. Some techniques represent texture on the basis of the spectral properties of an image. Others are model-based techniques that analyze texture by identifying an appropriate model that reflects the prior beliefs and knowledge about the type of images to be analyzed. There are textural features that describe local image statistics and others that describe global statistics.","authors":[{"name":"Srinivasan  Nagaraj","ids":["1844174"]},{"name":"G Narasinga rao","ids":["51061822"]},{"name":"K  Koteswararao","ids":["82623049"]}],"inCitations":["cb48d5daaf2d53ca7cb2606708b5df98ff040e15","a85308086598544d032956e49b0a6a8a67f87330","5871bfbf5e2fc4e7f469bfe8d7e179d515feeab3","c95bd922ef49698ebb6b8fc0cc398657896ad1a9","5f70580dd666215af25f1683c8eb8e16aaec4d53","c8553e59980e0a937bec64a5a7f261bf9cf6f774","b2cfa915a3dc2c9030c873a550b7533ad8eff0c7","b14d3abb05b9e77a733ff3e6ae59a4044cd848da","7b6bf96748367f8edd9dbd7e800e7f65e78baf2d","b9ede5f604668d0b62a306392cd03f47086e245e"],"outCitations":["61c2685157042db31a66d371c1b4e34bc23679f0","92c39bc216d7e9dd2303dae8555a24d6bc20765c","d0394e1607fb932c1ea5aa3e4654d3c80a915849","c5ab7a66a0a94137427bf5b4fbcac1ab710b9188","8d6015507fd730bb5fbd72f2af18ae79ff57a49a","664b701a39371c5356754dc72cea1349233c8506","c8c81a85bb3387c897e233173e1a0264e8d3e654","0aed632e3d576b6ab0945ac17a84cb008aae8ce2","be7f8329963148045eccf457c3c61d900c681b21","71c0f082a41c7f0b102c3ca9e4cf6b31f361d06a","707e5569d33bcd5be01df54e1f3f4a2911896053","480c367f58957ee6fed28aa0d64409992f09ba3a","8b72f80f2fdae35399f7f06419c8c5278e1b1c22","0b2a2ed870d9e947aca41daf751d987ab3163d74","3a54399b141999271e49c652979f65fcd968daa9","902cba18cd7aab10060a1ecdbcbd8e63256246d7","3bb5a439a0d610a7eac68f73068cdd278b8c9775","5273d26df3a50eb63f905e108aab67ab7d982f0c","722c787e99b3ea62c933cb6f1bdcc933024c4ae5","0b3cb1aec62ac81c3089376bf0114930a63d0391"],"year":2010,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/943795db51c56b84fbf9d64fe30ba437481973bf","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume8/number5/1207-1729?format=pdf","http://www.ijcaonline.org/volume8/number5/pxc3871729.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Computer Applications","journalVolume":"8","journalPages":"24-28","doi":"10.5120/1207-1729","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5120/1207-1729","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2154253115","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"65d504c906c7dbf44c6139e3cc8804bf2eacfc3a","title":"On local active contour model for automatic detection of tumor in MRI and mammogram images","paperAbstract":"Abstract Tumor segmentation in medical images is an important step to determine and predict the stage, size and progression of tumors in realistic geometries and may be used for diagnosis and treatment follow-up in MRI and mammogram images. Automating this challenging task helps radiologists to reduce the high manual workload of brain or breast cancer analysis. Detecting tumor in medical images means to quantify the structure contents of the tumor. In this paper, we propose a model for quantifying the structure contents of the tumor in MRI and mammogram images. The proposed model is based on optimized Laplacian of Gaussian, which is useful in smoothing the homogeneous region and highlight the boundaries of the tumor structure. The proposed model uses local intensity information in later stage of segmentation as image data fitting. For this purpose, local Gaussian distribution is used for fitting image data and is combined with level set function. Due to usage of local intensities and level set, the proposed model is able to deal with intensity inhomogeneity and capture different topologies. To stop the leakage of contour at the boundary of tumor, we take some geometrical points near the tumor's boundary and introduce a distance constraint in model. The gradient flow equation and other optimal values are obtained through minimization of the energy functional. The gradient flow equation is solved by using additive operator splitting method. The experimental results of the proposed model are validated by comparing it with existing state of the art models both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed model achieves average values of 99.96%, 99.88%, 99.91%, 99.91%, 99.95% for Jaccard similarity, dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity respectively, which are better than the existing models in comparison.","authors":[{"name":"Noor  Badshah","ids":["145028882"]},{"name":"Hena  Rabbani","ids":["2058498059"]},{"name":"Hadia  Atta","ids":["1742442209"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["af122304fc86d168119fb80820fde3838fc56d4c","408bf5e94eb49cb09d184acf53962cea0172c2f6","9404795f9c881efbecaacd4dfecfcb323eeeef2e","e78cc06481b15962d0c81d88e8bfc6ca5ccf7aed","b20c0758a38bd5a4083f64eff53af924499a8e29","f1a9737273047720f6928a49e4315c45fb546e21","5a6bb1d53e678593bc63c5b9ea9c7c90a49aa822","c54cc06e987d72119dba4877da926f8a82823ee2","47761b17aa40b0b08dc725b07634e95ba28b911e","0f491db4b6bf410da386cabebc209bda327bc671","439c2676259e95368c164d439b226337a5b2bbf0","a1067e837c7cbbefb30f8324c1eacb1afde39fc6","84870e0123270f6cf62f94673d0fd9c05f292742","dbf8652c371d176d7f96eb52b6dab2ada1613082","34b5f7bbc88728a5e3e86519251c88f777fc30b3","9394a5d5adcb626128b6a42c8810b9505a3c6487","4bcc01a61c477950d1ddf99b3a0e233244dda02a","04c5b56c012d418ad63b5711fbbfe76fbc3e8f38","abbfdc261d647cc4e3ec25a09f28024d68d92556","c17bece8f9212d983dd5b41e099b5950bd2606d5","67bb4ed102de7882958000e4e8ee327c29ed180e","4cdaf5247cbb6de37d0f1e8250f5450e351383d1","383c36a5e75e5e3c2ac9e92f4d07fbb580b065bc","1840d7418696f4c225fad8b7dc57a34d041a9273","8cdf5ae7952d9e0dd2a3926c60867c7c7d7130a1","4ff3a53f09cc9f46e330f72500d00f4232f6fdf3","6f7a711a777c9fed1797883e29b2931ed3fc1e6a","e489caa50a90d1e854c8b369fd93a182b67f7f9f","83c845fec6cc313c26c63fc0f7eaaadf6833b2a7","d8c86bd895d8271f9618966b7e95643b793980ba","a787173884ba9ee6d7d92c22d5a2b88f16a2e1d6","4574725c1abc74d60691a12207b33d3c1acef706","f5c0f7389dba2e784427c949aae403a61830dc48","1ab5178c20d22e3dcdf2b8dbe86b7430ca07186b","072fd4b1540c72b5dae16dcc6e9bc4c82b157d68","df181a19fa4050a7a0638ca7085a523c56a560be","af7dcf5e823f6e1eaa4aff2afa2912585ea32147","8170c416e3b85d808ab7688aa7cfdc83349fa532","0db927971bba2bf86f730790e1bd522a68a361bb","bb5d6dd12a791360ad63ecfdb113a41130e2c09e","ce8ee075d4861522adf54f8bd3ac734ac8d1ad33","6a4eb0b5258717ef65367f8a7ef9e6284c295030","d146f0095d795e1b8a082790b40467474d799711"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/65d504c906c7dbf44c6139e3cc8804bf2eacfc3a","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.101993"],"venue":"Biomed.

Accelerated re-planning will improve the efficiency of adaptive radiotherapy, especially for those on-line adaptation. Cone beam CT (CBCT) is a widely used in-room imaging for patient positioning for modern radiotherapy. CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy is an emerging technique for either offline or online plan adaptations. Accurately delineating tumor targets and organs-at-risk (OARs) is an important step in adaptive re-planning process, however, manual delineation can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially, for head and neck (HN) cancer cases, it could highly prolong the entire adaptational procedure due to the multiple OARs have to be contoured. In this study, we present a fully automated delineation method with a high quality of performance to expedite the contouring process of adaptive radiotherapy re-planning and dose-volume based plan evaluation and monitoring. In particular, a mask scoring regional neural network has been developed to extract the complementary features from CBCT and synthetic MRI for obtaining final segmentation. The synthetic MRI is generated by using a pre-trained cycle-consistent adversarial network given CBCT. Quantitative metrics including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance 95% (HD95), mean surface distance (MSD), and residual mean square distance (RMS) were used to evaluate our proposed method.

Methods G-DOC is home to 61 datasets that contain data from over 10,000 patients across 14 diseases (10 cancers and 4 non-cancers). 1700+ researchers from over 48 different countries worldwide currently use the platform. The data and tools in the G-DOC system have enabled over 40 research publications. G-DOC has the largest public collection of brain cancer patients from NCI Rembrandt dataset (671 patients).G-DOC integrates clinical, transcriptomic, metabolomic, microRNA, next generation sequencing (NGS) data, and MRI medical images with systems-level analysis tools into a single, user-friendly platform. The “Variant Search” feature in G-DOC currently enables exploratory analysis of mutations based on genes, chromosomes, and functional location. A researcher can use this feature to 1) identify clinically actionable mutations in their dataset 2) identify pathways that may be affected by these mutations, and 3) identify novel mutations in their dataset and explore their potential impact on protein function. Results and Conclusion We are currently working on developing features to support the import, integration, search, and retrieval of CLIA/CAP-certified cancer molecular diagnostic (molDx) data. This will enhance G-DOC’s interoperability with clinical and patient molecular profiling data that may be already stored in other databases. Our vision is to continuously improve and expand G-DOC with the long-term vision of supporting integration of informatics techniques into everyday research and practice.

The model has been presented for finding the field of special endoscope. For this purpose we built two programs that can manipulate medical data and provide images of the interior of the patient’s model. \nSpecifically, a study was done in the basic methods of Augmented Reality application in Surgery such as, the registration of the patient, the segmentation of medical data, their 3D reconstruction and the detection of endoscopic instruments and the camera. Has been presented the complete theoretical model for applying augmented reality and an analysis of individual procedures was done. Moreover we constructed with the help of Matlab two programs with their GUIs, for preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance/augmentation, respectively. Finally the programs were tested, using 22 MRI slices (format DICOM) with visible brain cancer in the left ventricle. Also were recorded images and data that we get at each step of programs implementation in order to evaluate them. \nThis model was constructed to implement the operations through the daVinci robotic machine. Nevertheless, the general application of the methodology developed in this study may find applications also in other endoscopic procedures","authors":[{"name":"Αναστασία  Δασκαλάκη","ids":["84099657"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2012,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4ad8456e60cac601671af5a7f639e87e044428c9","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"168793368","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"b25dfb3207ac6fec4ce6a6d16b7892a3a09e59ff","title":"SU-E-I-90: Magnetoencephalography (MEG): Quantitative Comparison of Oscillations and Synchronization Differences/similarities in Post-Surgery/pre-Irradiation Patients and Control Subjects.","paperAbstract":"PURPOSE\nTo evaluate brain synchronization and connectivity differences in post-surgery/per-irradiation patients and healthy controls with two different MEG approaches: ECD (equivalent current dipole) and SAM (synthetic aperture magnetometry).\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn 8 min resting state scan was collected from 5 post-surgery/pre-irradiation patients and 5 sex/age-matched control subjects. Scans were collected on a CTF MEG 275-sensors system. All subjects were scanned in upright, open-eyes position in a magnetically shielded room. MRI whole brain volume was divided into 4mm voxels allowing sensor signal space to be mapped into brain space. Measured signals were filtered into Δ, o/, α and β bandwidths and localized by ECD and SAM. SAM is a type of beamforming, a signal processing technique for sensor array data; the method works like a digital filter by focusing on each voxel while attenuating the majority of signal from all other voxels. Resultant SAM waveforms were evaluated to reject muscle and/or non-physiological artifacts. The ECD method was applied to the same data and bandwidths to localize sources, its orientations and strengths. Statistical analysis evaluated connectivity and synchronization using dPLI (direct phase lag index) and IC (imaginary coherence). Resultant SAM and ECD maps were compared for differences and similarities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCurrently the project is collecting data. The full per-irradiation data is expected to be completed by June 2013. The study goal is to establish the best method/approach to evaluate resting state MEG data.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe expect 3 possible outcomes of the study: no difference, subtle difference, statistically significant difference in resting state analysis between these two methods. The two first outcomes are easy to address by choosing the most time-efficient method.

Here, we apply two widely used algorithm for tumour detection (i) K-means clustering (ii) Fuzzy C Means clustering The segmentation algorithms are compared to estimate the efficiency by evaluating the execution time and accuracy of the algorithm. The result shows that the execution time is less in K-Means compared to Fuzzy C Means clustering technique, because the number of iterations of K-Means is less than Fuzzy C Means clustering . Further, the tumour area is calculated for accurate result Keywords — Image segmentation, K-Means clustering, Fuzzy C – means clustering techniques, Segmentation algorithms I. Introduction The recent survey [4] has concluded that brain tumour comes next to lung cancer around the world .Early detection and treatment can increase the rate of survival. Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)depends on computer technology to generate and display digital images Segmentation is an important process in most medical image analysis[12],[14]. It is very difficult to conduct surgery without using image processing techniques. Structures like tumour, brain tissue cannot be identified without image segmentation [3]. Clustering to Magnetic Resonance (MR) brain tumours maintains efficiency. Clustering is suitable for biomedical image segmentation as the number of clusters is usually known for images of particular regions of the human anatomy Here, an object density-based image segmentation [7],[10] is used, which incorporates intensity-based, edge-based and texture-based segmentation techniques. The method consist of three main stages: pre processing, object segmentation and final segmentation. Image enhancement, noise reduction and layer-of-interest extraction are some of the task of pre processing The paper presents the efficient use of clustering algorithm to detect the tumour cells from MR images which may present the characteristic of severity of the tumour such that required evaluation and treatment can be facilitated. In this paper, we present a segmentation method which helps in identifying the affected region and also able to calculate the affected area","authors":[{"name":"Rajaram M Gowda","ids":["144667817"]}],"inCitations":["d95a92dea119002448bbc9319baaaf0123e2df5f","c4f602e5c1b93ba810a48442cde6c5fe6615de76","89cc9230f47116ba9b7b0fd6d9bd598683b023d0","c10a357f9b4f6fbb7228200019e10d05b799b71d","9293ea4ddb3460c71e12a545f23b36db8a78abf1","4561d910f35ad36e547d4cb2115c3b74a142d315","946e1087e86b00e8e32de2ed992adfdbb6752e56","7f94b7556ba4318a7b7d19cd34553aaad27810f5"],"outCitations":["8412fde054871160e0ec06007bbef587ad726ba0","82111fa4168ca68904b9d9ded6649ba86d6451d4","1f14b29b758c590f90ce1cce77d3152da25271ad","e686a8bbabb2625973b107fe1b2bd5b573eedfa3","1caccb846f6a66f69c82a065b1306b74e7d4b02e","0b8f2ac1d72083c50704ab565ae5a9b5b938c7f4","bd7e1df00e462d8272dc2e69639bdb89dfb6340b","18b10ca7aeb3a0191bb3533f37ef5fcf30a2d904"],"year":2013,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d48a5febbe7ae37c77d69820a440e66d2a645d71","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2740807081","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"34469572953bc8f39eb416b4dc0274e3f1c1565f","title":"A TE GEL T DETECTION","paperAbstract":"A brain tumor position sensing method using an MI (magneto impedance) micro magnetic sensor in combination with fine magnetic particles (FMP for short) is proposed. Sensing of magnetic field generated from FMP accumulated in the brain tumor tissue would be an effective way to accurately detect the tumor position in the surgical operation. The spatial distributions of stray fields in gel samples, in which FMP were dispersed, were measured using an MI gradient-field sensor. The position of samples having FMP concentration of more than O.lg/l was clearly detected due to the high sensitivity (2 x Oe for a dc field) of the sensor. The spatia1 distributions were analyzed by a model of aligned dipole moments. The calculation results using the model were in good agreement with experimental results. Position sensing of the tumor tissue of a rat was also carried out. It was concluded that the proposed method would be useful for not only position sensing of the brain tumor but also 3D imaging of the tumor shape. I. INTRODUC~ION A surgical operation is useful for the direct medical treatment of a brain tumor. The displacement of the tumor position after craniotomy due to change of the inner brain pressure from the position detected by MRI measurement is a great problem for the operation. It is almost impossible to detect the tumor visually due to the same color of the tumor tissue and the normal tissue. These tissues could be classified magnetically, if €342' were accumulated specifically in the tumor tissue by conjugating the monoclonal antibody against a cancer-associated antigen with polyethylene glycol-coated magnetic particles(l). A hgNy sensitive and potable type micro magnetic sensor such as MI sensor having a resolution of lo5 Oe for a dc field(2-31 is required to detect a very weak and localized magnetic field generated from FMP in the tumor tissue. Furthermore, the sensor should be non-sensitive to disturbance uniform fields such as the terrestrial field. The gradent type MI sensor is able to respond to all these demands due to its high reduction rate of uniform fields(3). sensing of magnetite gel samples (imitations of the brain tumor) uskg an MI gradient magnetic field sensor are presented in hs paper. Spatial distributions of stray fields from the gel samples, in whch FMP were dispersed, are analyzed by a model of aligned dipole moments. The results for the tumor position sensing of a rat are also presented for the first step to a medical application.

playing havoc with thinking and memory, but Greg Lancaster’s tumor triggered a new insight into an entire field. Lancaster, a staff scientist at the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, was diagnosed with brain cancer in 1999. Doctors successfully removed the tumor and Lancaster has periodically followed up with his neurologist ever since. Each time, the neurologist obtains magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of Lancaster’s head and confirms that the tumor has not rebounded. During one such visit about three years ago, Lancaster says, the neurologist was showing him some images. “I asked him, ‘how do the other neurologists and other medical professionals analyze these images?’” Lancaster recalls. The answer: by comparing them side-by-side and painstakingly searching for differences between two scans. Lancaster, who studies image processing, knew there was a better way. His computerized approach, called the change detection system (CDS), is substantially faster and more accurate, he says. “My question at that time was, ‘we have all this technology available to us, why are you guys spending so much time in this archaic method of evaluating these images?’” The answer should be familiar to anyone who is familiar with interdisciplinary research: the people with the problem and the people with the solution were simply not aware of each others’ work. Fortunately, at least in the field of medical imaging, cross-pollination no longer requires serendipitous carcinogenesis. Approaches like Lancaster’s rely on the computerization of images and the dramatic increase in computing power in recent years, making the images easy to manipulate and analyze with software. Advances in computer science, physics and chemistry, combined with a surge in funding from agencies such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), have all led to a groundswell of new techniques, allowing scientists to see more—and better—than they ever had before. All the pieces “basically have come together in the recent past to bring these methodologies into patient care, both on the clinical side as well as the experimental side,” says Michael Knopp, professor of biomedical informatics at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus.","authors":[{"name":"Alan

Full wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations were performed for a single-loop copper (Cu) radio frequency (RF) surface resonator with a diameter of 30 mm optimized for rat brain imaging at room temperature (RT) and at liquid nitrogen (LN2) with a temperature of 77 K. A novel cryogenic Cu RF surface resonator with home-built LN2 nonmagnetic G10 fiberglass cryostat system for small animal scanner at 9.4 T was designed, built and tested in phantom and in in vivo MR measurements. Aerogel was used for thermal insulation in the developed LN2 cryostat. In this paper, we present the first in vivo 39K-MR images at 9.4 T for both healthy and stroke-induced rats using the developed cryogenic coil at 77 K. In good agreement with EM-simulations and bench-top measurements, the developed cryogenic coil improved the SNR by factor of 2.7 ± 0.2 in both phantom and in in vivo MR imaging compared with the same coil at RT.","authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim A.

As the idea of the paper we put two questions: 1. Can individual instances of real high-tech medical images work as AE when being analyzed with the use of neural networks? 2. Is it possible to defend oneself against such «natural» adversarial attacks with the simplest possible means? In our research, we tried the following defence methods: adversarial training, Gaussian data augmentation and bounded RELU (see section 3 for a detailed description). We conducted the experiment with the use of the neural network - a variant of convolutional network structure combining U-Net with the region proposal networks. As the source data two datasets were chosen - the Lung Image Database Consortium image collection containing 1018 lung cancer screening thoracic CT scans and Brain MRI DataSet containing clinical imaging data of glioma patients (a total of 274 cases). The experiments showed that the degree of manifestation of AE varies depending on the type of training model. When training a model not using techniques of defences on adversarial examples, the number of incorrectly recognized images is quite large (200 per 10,000 for CT and 285 per 10,000 for MRI). By proper selecting of the activation function of CNN, it can be reduced to 60 and 68, respectively. With augmentation of training dataset by Gaussian noised images, this number drops to 21 and 26. An even greater reduction in the number of incorrectly recognized images is achieved using the Adversarial Training method −12 and 15. Thus, it is shown that the adversarial effect is possible after the application of adversarial training techniques, but the degree of noise in such an image will be much higher than before using these techniques, and it will be easy enough for the doctor to recognize them visually and exclude them from further consideration.","authors":[{"name":"Aleksandra  Vatian","ids":["9366351"]},{"name":"Natalia  Gusarova","ids":["153391979"]},{"name":"Natalia  Dobrenko","ids":["2161259"]},{"name":"Sergey  Dudorov","ids":["34921235"]},{"name":"Niyaz  Nigmatullin","ids":["1380226943"]},{"name":"Anatoly  Shalyto","ids":["1740318"]},{"name":"Artem  Lobantsev","ids":["51887013"]}],"inCitations":["b3f843abb955eeb777a7c107b4b99c19e864d2fe","35d2f0eb6e3c2ff7f61434231f4a59c1f4c9a49b","6b321d368b3b23ed2f640204a2128dac5390339c","d37f3f484521d28d8b0c6ea9547f26eae75f9d28","d421187f0ea828fe7b5032105df3742c49caba8d"],"outCitations":["c44465bf5837980cd45446a4e22e07277e24994d","6714a62e878ab5a74a907e641421efd2db99e88f","8d8fe6ceb0a1b7116d530d1893a474043cb1374a","4fa6841e38408febe0f76fd0c6138c90605ff635","6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a","424561d8585ff8ebce7d5d07de8dbf7aae5e7270","a7078b356d1d7bfc06950856feb84cd3c3860812","1c46943103bd7b7a2c7be86859995a4144d1938b","707ef87813de2c792820121c23868fab569ec559","f645c139c1023cbb5dc570e8b8a5ad414b1ac982","4cc6f8e79411e02126ebb5e8256386f86df7e460","1c3cf4f600854fe885891a615b7ea3576ac8bc70","b544ca32b66b4c9c69bcfa00d63ee4b799d8ab6b","ee93681fd9b3b92b3136a3a73289199f87957560","280e7b1fe46f1549a2dd0d6b6417e3c43e400976","4535ecaf37ffc80ef4fe05561c034880388343d0","e7867244de690a1ae11a7a6d5a021e868fa75a3c","1c16dd87e39472f94c8510ddc7d6954dc6981bcd","63f875a5c8ca3b1875dbebabf8985cf9b0679665","bee044c8e8903fb67523c1f8c105ab4718600cdb","b3696562c6aeda6f0681c8f053eb263f7e35cc58","bcd7617473a263f32e6a4d0a71e324c2766d4e11","d891dc72cbd40ffaeefdc79f2e7afe1e530a23ad","f4fea83e3c9a849fb6bd4ea039f6feacfb0c3d49","df40ce107a71b770c9d0354b78fdd8989da80d2f","819167ace2f0caae7745d2f25a803979be5fbfae","8ba9c3c86695897520ace61cf766ae040d037599","c815815c5178e01695e11989d33a7ed64a15a329","6e02fda2e2583fada91c6617185443238c43e34c","7aa38b85fa8cba64d6a4010543f6695dbf5f1386"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e652ecf5c8ede7e4b1cbdd10e682d0a0814afc0","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.23919/FRUCT.2019.8711974"],"venue":"2019 24th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT)","journalName":"2019 24th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"472-478","doi":"10.23919/FRUCT.2019.8711974","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.23919/FRUCT.2019.8711974","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2944990428","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"dca164b208498f2c6a8bff199b7c855a90c66711","title":"MRQy: An Open-Source Tool for Quality Control of MR Imaging Data","paperAbstract":"PURPOSE\nThere is an increasing availability of large imaging cohorts (such as through The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)) for computational model development and imaging research. To ensure development of generalizable computerized models, there is a need to quickly determine relative quality differences in these cohorts, especially when considering MRI datasets which can exhibit wide variations in image appearance. The purpose of this study is to present a quantitative quality control tool, MRQy, to help interrogate MR imaging datasets for: (a) site- or scanner-specific variations in image resolution or image contrast, and (b) imaging artifacts such as noise or inhomogeneity; which need correction prior to model development.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUnlike existing imaging quality control tools, MRQy has been generalized to work with images from any body region to efficiently extract a series of quality measures (e.g. noise ratios, variation metrics) and MR image metadata (e.g. voxel resolution and image dimensions). MRQy also offers a specialized HTML5 based front-end designed for real-time filtering and trend visualization of quality measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMRQy was used to evaluate (a) n=133 brain MRIs from TCIA (7 sites), and (b) n=104 rectal MRIs (3 local sites). MRQy measures revealed significant site-specific variations in both cohorts, indicating potential batch effects. Before processing, MRQy measures could be used to identify each of the 7 sites within the TCIA cohort with 87.5%, 86.4%, 90%, 93%, 90%, 60%, and 92.9% accuracy and the 3 sites within the rectal cohort with 91%, 82.8%, and 88.9% accuracy; using unsupervised clustering. After processing, none of the sites could be distinctively clustered via MRQy measures in either cohort; suggesting that batch effects had been largely accounted for.

However several popular DR approaches suffer from sensitivity to choice of parameters and/or presence of noise in the data. In this paper, we present a novel DR technique known as consensus embedding that aims to overcome these problems by generating and combining multiple low-dimensional embeddings, hence exploiting the variance among them in a manner similar to ensemble classifier schemes such as Bagging. We demonstrate theoretical properties of consensus embedding which show that it will result in a single stable embedding solution that preserves information more accurately as compared to any individual embedding (generated via DR schemes such as Principal Component Analysis, Graph Embedding, or Locally Linear Embedding). Intelligent sub-sampling (via mean-shift) and code parallelization are utilized to provide for an efficient implementation of the scheme.ResultsApplications of consensus embedding are shown in the context of classification and clustering as applied to: (1) image partitioning of white matter and gray matter on 10 different synthetic brain MRI images corrupted with 18 different combinations of noise and bias field inhomogeneity, (2) classification of 4 high-dimensional gene-expression datasets, (3) cancer detection (at a pixel-level) on 16 image slices obtained from 2 different high-resolution prostate MRI datasets. In over 200 different experiments concerning classification and segmentation of biomedical data, consensus embedding was found to consistently outperform both linear and non-linear DR methods within all applications considered.ConclusionsWe have presented a novel framework termed consensus embedding which leverages ensemble classification theory within dimensionality reduction, allowing for application to a wide range of high-dimensional biomedical data classification and segmentation problems. Our generalizable framework allows for improved representation and classification in the context of both imaging and non-imaging data. The algorithm offers a promising solution to problems that currently plague DR methods, and may allow for extension to other areas of biomedical data analysis.","authors":[{"name":"Satish  Viswanath","ids":["144324804"]},{"name":"Anant  Madabhushi","ids":["1705442"]}],"inCitations":["d35f7c32edd3a76abb8d792d274f03488eb37a9a","6bfa998192295c39ad3acfbcc8dd5264002ea534","6f978453937742e41f2a1e7e047c1c21885d6325","4a8b7dee1adc09560c59fdaf7b048fa3dcc997a9","38ed8cb78590812bbbab4e632f177ef3485946aa","033a05565f8d6e47ee7a4b7cdded12b2012942b7","bdf46e8bcb021c3af92a228efefe5c9b4ff0a09f","a5a9b9446e94396ad5577ae31d5939cacd8061b7","c1a2a34e8710a032ad89be088d2000108db07d04","181b2717d17ac112c6b872dfe1c0426e710c9494","15d1a23690b6e8646abdae520b0f61c1092b7da1","78eb3c446ea6b7402fb6aad0af88e9dde8e919ee","ae03e1af37aa66d122d83503170d0125851e9529","4c44e248940fb1289c863cb3dbc01136f054e461","7433b34fc1f73094035154d3e33afa2e54830ba0","a96ebcd12e5c05bedc87531003c14c470a8496fa","1b796cad2ba353f94f79b2cc6a960564609f8854"],"outCitations":["278841ab0cb24c1abcb75e363aeed1fa741c8cc4","7d75c7abe0701189d060b477c67708a2e44d70cd","46d18654a053238b31195a2847241a047fca2535","c11d9e75ad70e98bd5f96a5d9c9aa319b038b3ad","46761fb75c28cd722d640e94c994b5135d3e4eca","33bb073a4d2605e9c8417ee23182dc2c9c4c05ef","b3c12e66b062ebbc18dd7b888af418818c3c45f4","5403a5c2839fad66e3f907518b11f41a56ec4e21","2deadb09624421ba1756249dba191bbcdb60ee11","400be635de58c0a88d724624b9860b5966112fc3","7fe7a235a3a9f9cb3996653829d96a227b4b5754","8df4c5bceac65b2dae684551ff6c747c04ebbcef","2bed698c9b6887936bc62c3b8f8f2186babef699","004c58731d17892c38bd6fccb9ebddd7547ecb15","19443b6a1bc87571cca36fffc5cd7f43d57cbc25","2d7f4be4b48c93e0f59abe95ca220b5b5842cd8e","34274f65f20d26b8c2dee8c0c8885505ad31f80d","cffb232640387094c189df8bffbc7777665640f0","01bb18da20a4f3871135a5c6a821d4d0ccb373b2","df83034e88557e1e2c7f9d268d90b19762312847","b94c7ff9532ab26c3aedbee3988ec4c7a237c173","fac97a6cb182236664fc55914004e0fafbead66e","7ebc5dce81440751692b8713a91808175e264ddf","48520c7b8ffcaed34318562a748e4b486dc24cbe","8db95dbd08e4ee64fb258e5380e78cfa507ed94d","794b9a29c674d807260f1e60769649bac00a3e50","50b7749edf80d160cf8e88e0c6e52004eac4a2ae","74a94c4248aebdfab8867cc8bed324a07116f6d1","5000bd9fb5032d3ff9034744b0642c7164a3d45e","0efb841403aa6252b39ae6975c1cc5410554ef7b","d9f54b2e00cc195d1ad1bbbeda3befd5e339f622","83e4b4132b32b58c00e50aedf341626b84ae7ef5","55b2eca534a4717cbb32118fc3407131abc69bbe","5f39fe2659603f4194fd638d1a2e17985415c3bb","351cc70f9526372b849de114981e518497c997dc","8573bbb55112c1f06c43211daedacc1578e69a92","d1ee87290fa827f1217b8fa2bccb3485da1a300e","7fdea3f89a623977101f7e168d4d228cf6658e68","1729f731482a628177a0fb81050966514c385e5e","7e8765917a4087a640c48f755ae82deb4b782b95","cc066a0a6010d9e20bcb6dfdeb85a268526b2b0c","89b68eb99fd004d21a545c446d65ac572c064100","ae9b523ef961c4fc55ef37455a2fdb7a79b0fd0a","6739c7a28f1b1ea63ab5fe96b186611486f93d45","eeaf10c9031f06122296cd0b0091872871462fa8","37dce700964865c15069d6f65ea1f82406968129","f62a8c59de7bb20da5030ed09a8892dd353f3a50","ac8ab51a86f1a9ae74dd0e4576d1a019f5e654ed","c87d39d19b96f288e42c393303a984342fcd51d0","7a92314ff9ef62aab0f30510225736aa30aa7b84","3537fcd0ff99a3b3cb3d279012df826358420556","74f4ecc3e4e5b91fbb54330b285ed5214afe2001","08892ce846e89b21c9e5e99f5ab3ecf487d4c04a","ccf5208521cb8c35f50ee8873df89294b8ed7292","1fdb62555eb650662dbe2a6f3985d390861597c2","d432dfe1d7763d584621a5d65bec6cf957d7aa3e","81c0b1135741385de2fc99307065f9741edaec86","b41d0fa5fdaadd47fc882d3db04277d03fb21832","d37396c40a53edf789ebe9ce62b5409085a5f3cf"],"year":2011,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7e57d7ea26e689396163799d06dce8697099219a","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2105-13-26?site=bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com","http://engineering.case.edu/centers/ccipd/sites/ccipd.case.edu/files/publications/Consensus-embedding---theory","-algorithms-and-application-to-segmentation-and-classification-of-biomedical-data.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34153544"],"venue":"BMC Bioinformatics","journalName":"BMC Bioinformatics","journalVolume":"13","journalPages":"26 - 26","doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-13-26","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-13-26","pmid":"22316103","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2102445822","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"e5e7df024674af04f1febd729b3e64ca4f12d1b4","title":"AGuIX radiosensitizing nanoparticles: from molecular events to clinical applications","paperAbstract":"AGuIX (Activation and Guidance by Irradiation X) is a non-toxic gadolinium-based nanoparticle (GBN) (due to gadolinium entrapped in DOTA) developed by the Lyon University. It accumulates in the tumor through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and clears rapidly through the kidneys due to its small size (sub-5nm). Furthermore, AGuIX demonstrates good performance as a contrast agent for MRI. \nWe performed a proof of concept on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), metastatic melanoma and chondrosarcoma tumors, known for their low survival rates, demonstrating the radiosensitizing efficacy of the AGuIX nanoparticles in cellular (2D and 3D cultures) and preclinical models. GBNs enter HNSCC cancer cells by passive diffusion and macropinocytosis (Rima et al, 2013), localize in cytoplasm, as free particle or entrapped in lysosomes, in close vicinity to the mitochondria. Gadolinium combined with irradiation can produce a large variety of secondary emissions such as secondary, Auger, and Compton electrons leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that trigger an intra‐mitochondrial stress (ROS production, transmembrane potential decrease, mtDNA deletion) and nuclear DNA damage leading to cell death. \nRelative biological efficiency (RBE) in cancer cells is quite comparable to that observed in response to carbon ions, suggesting the existence of common mechanisms through the amplification of the local dose (Miladi et al. Al., Nanomedicine 2015, Wozny et al., submitted). \nThe efficacy of AGuIX has also been demonstrated in orthotopic xenograft models of HNSCC and metastatic melanoma (Miladi et al., 2015, Kotb et al., Theranostics 2016); the experiments are ongoing for chondrosarcoma. \nRegulatory toxicity studies were conducted in rats and monkeys and a first clinical study was initiated in patients with multiple brain metastases (clinicaltrial.gov). \nThis presentation will summarize our current results with AGuIX nanoparticles used in radiobiology and imaging as well as their first clinical applications. \nSupported by LabEx PRIMES (ANR-11-LABX-0063)","authors":[{"name":"Claire  Rodriguez-Lafrasse","ids":["1398236606"]},{"name":"Marie-Thérèse  Aloy","ids":["144006132"]},{"name":"Jacqueline Sidi Boumedine","ids":["82188616"]},{"name":"Shady  Kotb","ids":["48727489"]},{"name":"Lucie  Sancey","ids":["5121413"]},{"name":"Géraldine Le Duc","ids":["39065567"]},{"name":"François  Lux","ids":["145122946"]},{"name":"Jacques  Balosso","ids":["4516293"]},{"name":"Camille  Verry","ids":["5181327"]},{"name":"Marc  Janier","ids":["75091499"]},{"name":"Olivier  Tillement","ids":["6521291"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e5e7df024674af04f1febd729b3e64ca4f12d1b4","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"2765724658","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"04dbeb52339888a9277472253ee4d3036f0feada","title":"Hollow manganese oxide nanoparticles as multifunctional agents for magnetic resonance imaging and drug delivery.","paperAbstract":"Nanometer-sized colloidal particles with small size and large surface area have many superior properties when used as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, such as their ability to carry large payloads of active magnetic centers, easy penetration of biological membranes, long blood circulation times, and efficient conjugation to affinity molecules. Thus, they have the potential to allow us to visualize targets at low imaging-agent concentration with high sensitivity and sepcificity. Furthermore, nanoparticles can be used in combination with therapeutic agents as bifunctional medical systems that enable simultaneous MRI diagnosis and drug treatment. For example, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have been developed as efficient T2 contrast agents and employed to image tumors, stem cell migration, and cancer metastases. Some colloidal nanoparticles containing gadolinium(III) or manganese(II) have recently been reported as potent T1 MRI contrast agents. [4] Very recently, some of the present authors developed MnO nanoparticles as T1 contrast agents for MRI signal enhancement of the anatomic brain structure. The further development of nanoparticle MRI contrast agents will require materials with higher relaxivity than the current state of the art that can operate at much lower concentrations of potentially toxic metal ions such as Gd and Mn. In this context, hollow nanoparticles with interior void spaces are attractive candidates owing to their large water-accessible surface areas, which are able to carry high payloads of MR-active magnetic centers, and because they can take up a large amount of therapeutic drug within the interior void. While hollow nanoparticles containing magnetic ions have recently been prepared through several synthetic strategies, there are few examples of the investigation of their medical applications. Herein, we report a novel and facile synthesis of hollow manganese oxide nanoparticles (HMONs) and their potential application as multifunctional agents for simultaneous MR imaging and drug delivery. We demonstrate the greatly improved relaxivities of the hollow nanoparticles along with their efficient cellular uptake and drug loading capacities. These properties allow us to develop these particles for the delivery of therapeutic drugs as well as for diagnostic imaging. Manganese oxide nanoparticles with a diameter of 20 nm stabilized by oleic acid (MONs) as well as water-dispersible manganese oxide nanoparticles (WMONs) were prepared using a reported procedure involving the thermal decomposition of a manganese oleate complex and encapsulation with poly(ethylene glycol) phospholipid. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns revealed that MnO is the main component of both MONs and WMONs and showed an increase of the Mn3O4 fraction in the WMONs. The analysis of the surface composition with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated the presence of Mn and Mn (see the Supporting Information). On the basis of these observations, it was presumed that the as-synthesized MONs were passivated with Mn3O4 formed by their contact with air, even under an organic solvent, and that further oxidation occurred to form a thicker Mn3O4 shell when they were transferred into water. Very recently, the oxidation of the surface of MnO nanoparticles in air was also reported.

U-Net Architecture for Gliomas","paperAbstract":"Purpose: Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with varying degrees of aggressiveness and prognosis. Understanding of tumor biology and intra-tumor heterogeneity is necessary for planning personalized therapy and predicting response to therapy. Accurate tumoral and intra-tumoral segmentation on MRI is the first step toward understanding the tumor biology through computational methods. The purpose of this study was to design a segmentation algorithm and evaluate its performance on pre-treatment brain MRIs obtained from patients with gliomas. Materials and Methods: In this study, we have designed a novel 3D U-Net architecture that segments various radiologically identifiable sub-regions like edema, enhancing tumor, and necrosis. Weighted patch extraction scheme from the tumor border regions is proposed to address the problem of class imbalance between tumor and non-tumorous patches. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and the symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. The Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based architecture is trained on 285 patients, validated on 66 patients and tested on 191 patients with Glioma from Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 challenge dataset. Three dimensional patches are extracted from multi-channel BraTS training dataset to train 3D U-Net architecture. The efficacy of the proposed approach is also tested on an independent dataset of 40 patients with High Grade Glioma from our tertiary cancer center. Segmentation results are assessed in terms of Dice Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Hausdorff 95 distance (ITCN intra-tumoral classification network). Result: Our proposed architecture achieved Dice scores of 0.88, 0.83, and 0.75 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively, on BraTS validation dataset and 0.85, 0.77, 0.67 on test dataset. The results were similar on the independent patients' dataset from our hospital, achieving Dice scores of 0.92, 0.90, and 0.81 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study show the potential of patch-based 3D U-Net for the accurate intra-tumor segmentation. From experiments, it is observed that the weighted patch-based segmentation approach gives comparable performance with the pixel-based approach when there is a thin boundary between tumor subparts.","authors":[{"name":"Ujjwal  Baid","ids":["1455206803"]},{"name":"Sanjay  Talbar","ids":["39970431"]},{"name":"Swapnil  Rane","ids":["40239871"]},{"name":"Sudeep  Gupta","ids":["144717490"]},{"name":"Meenakshi H.

On the other hands, electrical bioimpedances contain different information related to tissue structures and their physiological states and functions. It is well known that the electrical properties of biological tissues differ significantly depending on their structure. This has been reported by investigators studying the application of differences in the electrical properties of tumors to the clinical aspect. Electrical properties of malignant breast tumors have been investigated by Frinke and Morse. They found significantly higher permeability of the tumor tissue at 20 kHz compared to normal or nonmalignant tissues. Similar results have been reported by several other investigations. Our group has measured directly electrical impedances of benign breast tumor and malignant breast tumor by needle electrodes. Our group has developed the non-invasive electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ). The purposes of this study were to estimate the electrical conductivity of localized tissues by non-invasive measurement of the electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) on localized tissues. This EIT methods has a possibility of early detection of breast cancer and can be used for young women breast cancers which are difficult to be found by mammography because of dense breasts. In this conference, we illustrate our new theory of non-invasive measurement of EIT. Our group ( Department of Surgery of The University of Tokushima and Institute of Technology and Science of The University of Tokushima ) has studied and developed EIT since 1980s and has experimented with non-invasive measurement of EIT since 2000s. A new impedance analytical system was developed, and measurements were performed over a frequency range of 0-100kHz by the four-electrode method. The biological tissue can be regarded electrically as an equivalent consisting of extracellular resistance ( Re ), intracellular resistance ( Ri ), and electrical capacitance of the cell membrane ( Cm ). These three parameter were calculated from the measured values of electrical bio-impedance by the curve-fitting technique using a computer program. It was found that Re and Ri of breast cancers were significantly lower than those of benign tumors, and that Cm of breast cancers was significantly lower than that of benign tumors. Ito Laboratory, Department of Medical System Engineering at Chiba University developed an organism equivalence phantom. Our group used the phantom and made one-layer phantom ( muscle or brain ) and two-layers phantom ( muscle and brain ). Our group measured the electrical conductivity of these one layer and two layers phantoms by our non-invasive measurement of EIT. One-layer phantom was measured by our non-invasive measurement of EIT. The errs of impedance between measured by our new EIT and by ordinary method were whthin 5 %. These results were satisfactorily and proved that one-layer muscle or brain could be measured correctly by our new measurement . But two-layers ( muscle and brain ) phantom was measured by our non-invasive measurement of EIT, the errs of impedance were over 20%. These results were unsatisfactorily. These results suggest that one layer tissues of muscle or brain can be diagnosed by our non-invasive measurement of EIT. Now we are making an improved two layers phantome which are muscle and fat tissue and measure these impedances. If we will be able to a make multi- layers phantom and measure these impedances correctly, our new method will be used by early breast cancer screening.","authors":[{"name":"Kenji  Okazaki","ids":["2061126917"]},{"name":"Akira  Tangoku","ids":["5586945"]},{"name":"Tadaoki  Morimoto","ids":["49474081"]},{"name":"Keigo  Hattori","ids":["2053205597"]},{"name":"Ryosuke  Kotani","ids":["2067011370"]},{"name":"Emiko  Yasuno","ids":["2443793"]},{"name":"Masatake  Akutagawa","ids":["2565873"]},{"name":"Yohsuke  Kinouchi","ids":["1767835"]}],"inCitations":["51c140f5988992f63e4f740153b5f9e9b3b8e081","bd20eee71651b25137f8b6ef008b061c08d35f0e","b86a83bc0fca6c4dcf7734e1d4695a54bca9eab1","e661d9e0e2bbbc32e3866b7b5c66f9d7d0441b8c","a6fe1ca9ccfacdc7b524b433e08f8adc5028cfcc"],"outCitations":["fb2ca87849f00abbc6245984e6053db4a791c6a2","6e511a70e9b814fd9a246235b6c9642e48e8bb0d","a7a67f3ae1b31477f957e88915fd00f5c615296e","15dae0883b44d19d6493cd5cd3d9589e91639363","9ff54050af570b22b7ca66dede2901974d2cd9f1","e15b4a5378b6f2930ca58196322d621df2512e37","c9fb920e6e32e7d39af0b1d9fdb5bb32f273369d","43d351f7d4370fd3e927e4228f0e9ed8aa7cd120","2e9c98ea48697f43866f351d02610cf6ac678292","6b97b29f2516672483614cc1ab3c97b2903c2d40","778583a20372767e729b5c4918ee67e8b910c796","5b84e1ae315ac8bf5b7638a73189a67c69d9bf86"],"year":2009,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/baf6f474325f9a8fb17f2ba5666693641fec2413","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"2009 International Conference on Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Engineering","journalName":"2009 International Conference on Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Engineering","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-5","doi":"10.1109/ICBPE.2009.5384102","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBPE.2009.5384102","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"2147262992","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"273a9755b2cf09620a5e91c0c7bd220f7b6d616a","title":"Real-Time-functional MRI Explorer","paperAbstract":"In this paper we present a system that allows onlinecontrol of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. With the beginning of the fMRI experiment, the functional volumes are real-time exported to an external PC. The statistical relevance of each voxel's activation is then calculated by correlation analysis. After calculation, the activation maps are overlaid to an anatomical data set. The real-time visualization of the activated voxels in combination with the morphology gives relevant information to the physician at experiment’s run time. The physician can set different levels of significance for activation, can investigate both slice-wise and as a 3d rendered volume, and can take localization measurements in Talairach coordinates. The system is in use in cooperation with the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg and the Otto-SelzInstitute at the University of Mannheim. The aim is to detect activated brain areas during somatosensory stimulation with experimental pain models. The presented system allows monitoring ongoing fMRI experiments in order to optimize experimental design and slice positioning. Introduction Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a noninvasive method that allows monitoring neuronal activation to external stimulation. Since the difference between active and non-active regions is about 2-3% of the total MRI-signal, averaging, and in particular, statistical testing are mandatory in order to locate active brain areas. An fMRI measurement can take some tens of minutes, and requires an even longer statistical postprocessing of the data. Unsuccessful experiments may often turn out to be unsuccessful after a long delay only, when subjects or patients are no longer available for investigation. Real-time functional MRI allows adaptation of experimental parameters or removal of artifact sources during the same experimental session. Measuring brain activation due to somatosensory and especially painful stimulation requires careful experimental design and slice positioning. Real-time fMRI can be used for a first check of the stimulation design and may also be used to select a reduced set of slices for monitoring specific brain regions with improved time resolution, compared with a wholebrain fMRI acquisition. The only fMRI-online evaluation program we know is that of the fire-project [1-3]. In contrast to this project we only use a standard PC and a newer rendering library VGL3.1 with our own rendering software. RT-fMRI-Explorer The basic idea of the RT-fMRI-Explorer is to support fMRI measurements by online monitoring. In order to realize this, we have chosen the following system design: first, an anatomical data set is acquired and sent to an external PC via TCP/IP. When starting functional measurements, a data collector is started on the hostcomputer of the MR scanner, which collects the functional data volumes and sends them to the external PC via TCP/IP during ongoing measurements. The software on the external PC performs a sliding-window correlation analysis of the last N incoming functional data volumes with a predefined ideal stimulus function f(x) which indicates the time course of stimulation. Classical fMRI “blocked-designs”, where the stimulus is alternately switched on and off, are coded by a sequence of 0 (=OFF) and 1 (=ON). The resulting square wave might be additionally convoluted with an ideal hemodynamic response function (HRF), to provide an ideal estimator for stimulation effects. Fig. 1: Internal architecture of the RT-fMRI-Explorer. Fig. 2: Volume rendering of the brain in combination with the activated areas in one image (red and yellow). The sliding window correlation analysis provides a simple functional activity measure for each voxel, which is transformed onto a parametric functional map. Anatomical data and functional maps are rendered together by the VGL rendering engine (using VGL3.1 as rendering library) and then displayed on the screen of the external PC.

It is used for different purposes in our daily life such as face recognition, speech recognition, text translation in different languages, weather prediction, and business prediction. In parallel, ML also plays an important role in the medical domain such as in medical imaging. ML has various algorithms that need to be trained with large volumes of data to produce a well-trained model for prediction. Aim: The aim of this study is to highlight the most suitable Data Augmentation (DA) technique(s) for medical imaging based on their results. Methods: DA refers to different approaches that are used to increase the size of datasets. In this study, eight DA approaches were used on publicly available low-grade glioma tumor datasets obtained from the Tumor Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) repository. The dataset included 1961 MRI brain scan images of low-grade glioma patients. You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 3 model was trained on the original dataset and the augmented datasets separately.

Neoplasm is basically a sort of abnormal excessive cell growth but when it generates a mass, it is referred as tumors. Brain tumor (BT) is a deadly disease and also it is regarded as a common sort of cancer on adults and even on children. Therefore, early recognition of the correct sort of BT is significant for devising a proper treatment chart and envisioning patients' response to the adopted treatment. Human understanding of countless medical images (Abnormal or Normal) may bring misclassification and thereby there is a requisite of the automated recognition system for classifying the BT types. This paper offers an effective framework for classifying the BT from the multi-modality Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) by employing ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) classifier. Primarily, the input data-set undertakes the process of skull stripping. Subsequently, the resultant skull striped image undergoes preprocessing utilizing AHE (Adaptive Histogram Equalization). Subsequently, the clustering process is done by employing the Modified-Fuzzy C Means (MFCM) clustering algorithm. From the benign and malignant classes, features are extorted, and then the optimized features are attained utilizing the Adaptive Elephant Herd Optimization (AEHO) algorithm. Finally, the different sorts of BT are effectively classified by implementing the ANFIS classifier. The outcomes are examined and contrasted to the other conventional techniques to corroborate that the proposed work classifies the BT in great efficiency.","authors":[{"name":"R.

For the first set, 8 organs at risk to be spared during the therapy were segmented: mandible, brainstem and both left/right optic nerves, parotid and submandibular glands. For the neurological set, 4 paired brain structures were segmented: left/right caudate, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. For both cases a leave one out approach was used for validation. Tests were performed on common hardware (Intel Xeon CPU @ 2.5 GHz, 8 GB of RAM).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSegmentation accuracy was quantified in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile of Hausdorff Distance (HD). The average DSCs computed over all the labels were 0.70 for H&N application and 0.85 for neuroscience case. HD values confirm the DSCs (4.92 mm and 1.41 mm). Average segmentation time for the two applications was 35 and 120 mins respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPlastimatch MABS has been validated for multi atlas based segmentation of medical images. Accuracy was demonstrated for different anatomical districts and image modalities. The results show that Plastimatch MABS can be used for a wide range of applications. The presented approach can provide fully automatic and robust segmentation and is also compatible with timing requirements for clinical applications.","authors":[{"name":"P  Zaffino","ids":["3480003"]},{"name":"P  Raudaschl","ids":["3313428"]},{"name":"K  Fritscher","ids":["1951082"]},{"name":"M  Spadea","ids":["2648180"]},{"name":"G  Sharp","ids":["2763914"]}],"inCitations":["1f6a48c87ea56574e0a192ec74047ff0b1a1794c"],"outCitations":[],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24d68d09dcef76d8c79cc94ecb2563b752e8a3ee","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Medical physics","journalName":"Medical physics","journalVolume":"43 6","journalPages":"3658","doi":"10.1118/1.4957019","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1118/1.4957019","pmid":"28047131","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2466843543","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"e0715989391c8f08e8a9371bcdb5d18f23d9bd94","title":"Improvements in magnetic resonance imaging excitation pulse design","paperAbstract":"This thesis focuses on the design of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radio-frequency (RF) excitation pulses, and its primary contributions are made through connections with the novel multiple-system single-output (MSSO) simultaneous sparse approximation problem. The contributions are both conceptual and algorithmic and are validated with simulations, as well as anthropogenic-object-based and in vivo trials on MRI scanners. Excitation pulses are essential to MRI: they excite nuclear spins within a subject that are detected by a resonant coil and then reconstructed into images. Pulses need to be as short as possible due to spin relaxation, tissue heating, and main field inhomogeneity limitations. When magnetic spins are tilted by only a small amount, pulse transmission may be interpreted as depositing energy in a continuous three-dimensional Fourier-like domain along a one-dimensional contour to form an excitation in the spatial domain. Pulse duration is proportional to the length of the contour and inversely proportional to the rate at which it is traversed, and the rate is limited by system gradient hardware restrictions. Joint design of the contour and a corresponding excitation pulse is a difficult and central problem, while determining near-optimal energy deposition once the contour is fixed is significantly easier. We first pose the NP-Hard MSSO problem and formulate greedy and convex relaxationbased algorithms with which to approximately solve it. We find that second-order-cone programming and iteratively-reweighted least squares approaches are practical techniques for solving the relaxed problem and prove that single-vector sparse approximation of a complex-valued vector is an MSSO problem. We then focus on pulse design, first comparing three algorithms for solving linear systems of multi-channel excitation design equations, presenting experimental results from a 3 Tesla scanner with eight excitation channels. Our aim then turns toward the joint design of pulses and trajectories. We take joint design in a novel direction by utilizing MSSO theory and algorithms to design short-duration sparsity-enforced pulses. These pulses are used to mitigate transmit field inhomogeneity in the human brain at 7 Tesla, a significant step towards the clinical use of high-field imaging in the study of cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. Pulses generated by the sparsity-enforced method outperform those created via conventional Fourier-based techniques, e.g., when attempting to produce a uniform magnetization in the presence of severe RF inhomogeneity, a 5.7-ms 15-spoke pulse generated by the sparsity-enforced method produces an excitation with 1.28 times lower root-mean-square error than conventionallydesigned 15-spoke pulses.

(HCC) Tumor in a Subcutaneous Xenograft Murine Model","paperAbstract":"Histotripsy fractionates tissue through a mechanical, non-invasive ultrasonic ablation process that precisely controls acoustic cavitation while utilizing real-time ultrasound (US) imaging guidance. This study investigates the potential, feasibility and tumor volume reduction effects of histotripsy for liver cancer ablation in a subcutaneous in vivo murine Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) model. Hep3B tumors were generated in the right flanks of 14 NSG and 7 NOD-SCID mice. The mice were grouped as follows: A (acute, NSG with n=9 treatment and n=1 control), B (chronic, NSG with n=2 treatment and n=2 control) and C (chronic NODSCID, with n=6 treatment and n=1 control). Treatment was performed when the tumor diameters reached >5 mm. 1-2 cycle histotripsy pulses at 100 Hz PRF (p- >30 MPa) were delivered using a custom built 1 MHz therapy transducer attached to a motorized positioner, which scanned the transducer focus to traverse the targeted tumor volume, guided by real-time US imaging. Tumor ablation effectiveness was assessed by obtaining T1, T2 and T2* weighted MR images. Post euthanasia, treated tumor, brain, and lung tissue samples were harvested for histology. Histology of acute group A showed fractionation of targeted region with a sharp boundary separating it from untreated tissue. Groups B and C demonstrated effective tumor volume reduction post treatment on MRI as the homogenate and edema were resorbed within 23 weeks. However, as the tumor was subcutaneous, it was not possible to set adequate treatment margin and since the mice were immune-compromised, residual viable tumor cells eventually developed into tumor regrowth at 3-9 weeks after histotripsy. Groups B and C showed no signs of metastasis in the lung and brain. Our study successfully demonstrated the potential of histotripsy for non-invasive HCC ablation in a subcutaneous murine model. Additional work is ongoing to study the response of histotripsy in immune-competent orthotopic liver tumor models.","authors":[{"name":"Tejaswi  Worlikar","ids":["31008955"]},{"name":"Eli  Vlaisavljevich","ids":["2838695"]},{"name":"Tyler  Gerhardson","ids":["13792195"]},{"name":"Joan  Greve","ids":["48828929"]},{"name":"Shanshan  Wan","ids":["46703438"]},{"name":"Sibu  Kuruvilla","ids":["51899558"]},{"name":"Jonathan  Lundt","ids":["7755912"]},{"name":"Kimberly  Ives","ids":["144098333"]},{"name":"Timothy  Hall","ids":["2317020"]},{"name":"Theodore H.

It now takes under 1 min to be acquired and can bring valuable information and pathophysiologic insight in many diseases. The same transition is currently happening in DTI, which is expected to contribute much novel clinical and neuroscientific information presently not accessible by other technologies. For instance, DTI is the only approach for tracking brain white matter fibers non-invasively in the human brain. In combination with functional MRI, which can outline activated cortical networks, DTI may thus provide clues on functional connectivity. DTI is also increasingly been used to demonstrate subtle connectivity anomalies in a variety of dysfunctions, such as cerebral palsy, cancer, stroke, dyslexia, or diseases including multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. Before DTI can become true clinical routine, some progress is still needed. This relates to factors such as scan time and therefore, patient tolerance, and the complexity of post-processing (now mostly off-line) required for the method. These issues are already being addressed. For instance, clinical equipment with whole-body gradients of up to 8 G/cm is becoming available, which, together with the clinical availability of 3-Tesla magnets will allow the use of multi-directional DTI at high spatial resolution (around 2×2×2 mm3) in a few minutes. Another issue that is often discussed is which quantitative parameter to choose, FA, RA, etc. Actually, these anisotropies are all related and the only advantage of using one versus the other will be based on contrast to noise, which depends on anisotropy of the particular structure being studied. It would be most helpful if all researchers would report the eigenvalues so that others can calculate any parameter they want. A further essential consideration for data analysis and reporting is the influence of partial volume effects between different structures.

segmentation","paperAbstract":"Automated segmentation of medical images is a challenging problem. The number of segments in a medical image may be unknown a priori, due to the presence or absence of pathological anomalies. Some unsupervised learning techniques founded in information theory concepts may provide a solid approach to this problem’s solution. We have developed the Improved “Jump” Method (IJM), a technique that efficiently finds a suitable number of clusters representing different tissue characteristics in a medical image. IJM works by optimizes an objective function that quantifies the quality of particular cluster configurations. Recent developments involving interesting relationships between Spectral Clustering (SC) and kernel Principal Component Analysis (kPCA) are used to extend IJM to the non-linear domain. This novel SC approach maps the data to a new space where the points belonging to the same cluster are collinear if the parameters of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel are adequately selected. After projecting these points onto the unit sphere, IJM measures the quality of different cluster configurations, yielding an algorithm that simultaneously selects the number of clusters, and the RBF kernel parameter. Validation of this method is sought via segmentation of MR brain images in a combination of all major modalities. Such labeled MRI datasets serve as benchmarks for any segmentation algorithm. The effectiveness of the nonlinear IJM is demonstrated in the segmentation of uterine cervix color images for early identification of cervical neoplasia, as an aid to cervical cancer diagnosis. Studies are in progress in segmentation and detection of multiple sclerosis lesions.","authors":[{"name":"Enrique  Corona","ids":["143873381"]},{"name":"Jason E.

Recent advancements in hardware in the form of RF coils and gradient sets have resulted in a good outlook for MRSI to be used in detection, localization, and classification of the lesions. Work done by other groups has shown that merging molecular imaginginformation from MRSI with anatomic scans used for treatment planning proved beneficial in delineating the tumor volume. MRSI involves defining an MRimage volume which can be divided into a matrix of 3‐D sub‐volumes. Spectroscopic data is then acquired for all these sub‐volumes simultaneously. This leads to the quantification and localization of different levels of metabolites such as Choline, Creatine and N‐ acetylaspartate that are highly useful in detecting and possibly staging lesions. We focused on performing MRSI on the brain using a head transmit/receive (T/R) coil. Utilizing a reduced 2‐Dimensional Point Resolved Spectroscopy (2‐D PRESS) Turbo Spectroscopic Imaging (TSI) sequence to improve the spectral resolution of different metabolite peaks and the spatial resolution of the spectroscopic scan, good spectral/spatial information can be acquired revealing more accurate bio‐chemical imaging. Thus, an MRSI study could be easily used for improved treatment planning. Using 3T MRI we have improved the spatial resolution of the MRSI scans to 5×5×10mm3/voxel, meanwhile maintaining a good signal to noise ratio. This would increase the spatial relevance of the spectra acquired in the scan and in turn provide more information in the treatment planning phase.","authors":[{"name":"A. A.

CNNs were shown to be successful for segmentation of brain tumors into multiple regions or labels. However, in the environment which fosters data-sharing and collection of multi-institutional datasets, a question arises: does training with data from another institution with potentially different imaging equipment, contrast protocol, and patient population impact the segmentation performance of the CNN? Our study presents preliminary data towards answering this question. Specifically, we used MRI data of glioblastoma (GBM) patients for two institutions present in The Cancer Imaging Archive. We performed a process of training and testing CNN multiple times such that half of the time the CNN was tested on data from the same institution that was used for training and half of the time it was tested on another institution, keeping the training and testing set size constant. We observed a decrease in performance as measured by Dice coefficient when the CNN was trained with data from a different institution as compared to training with data from the same institution. The changes in performance for the entire tumor and for four different labels within the tumor were: 0.72 to 0.65 (p=0.06), 0.61 to 0.58 (p=0.49), 0.54 to 0.51 (p=0.82), 0.31 to 0.24 (p<0.03), and 0.43 to 0.31(p<0.003) respectively. In summary, we found that while data across institutions can be used for development of CNNs, this might be associated with a decrease in performance.","authors":[{"name":"David  Paredes","ids":["2075505910"]},{"name":"Ashirbani  Saha","ids":["36032589"]},{"name":"Maciej A.

One challenge of multimodal image registration is that typical similarity measures rely on statistical correlations between image intensities to determine anatomical alignment. The use of alternate image representations could allow for mapping of intensities into a space or representation such that the multimodal images appear more similar, thus facilitating their co-registration. In this work, we present a spectral embedding based registration (SERg) method that uses non-linearly embedded representations obtained from independent components of statistical texture maps of the original images to facilitate multimodal image registration. Our methodology comprises the following main steps: 1) image-derived textural representation of the original images, 2) dimensionality reduction using independent component analysis (ICA), 3) spectral embedding to generate the alternate representations, and 4) image registration. The rationale behind our approach is that SERg yields embedded representations that can allow for very different looking images to appear more similar, thereby facilitating improved co-registration. Statistical texture features are derived from the image intensities and then reduced to a smaller set by using independent component analysis to remove redundant information. Spectral embedding generates a new representation by eigendecomposition from which only the most important eigenvectors are selected. This helps to accentuate areas of salience based on modality-invariant structural information and therefore better identifies corresponding regions in both the template and target images. The spirit behind SERg is that image registration driven by these areas of salience and correspondence should improve alignment accuracy. In this work, SERg is implemented using Demons to allow the algorithm to more effectively register multimodal images. SERg is also tested within the free-form deformation framework driven by mutual information. Nine pairs of synthetic T1-weighted to T2-weighted brain MRI were registered under the following conditions: five levels of noise (0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7%) and two levels of bias field (20% and 40%) each with and without noise. We demonstrate that across all of these conditions, SERg yields a mean squared error that is 81.51% lower than that of Demons driven by MRI intensity alone. We also spatially align twenty-six ex vivo histology sections and in vivo prostate MRI in order to map the spatial extent of prostate cancer onto corresponding radiologic imaging. SERg performs better than intensity registration by decreasing the root mean squared distance of annotated landmarks in the prostate gland via both Demons algorithm and mutual information-driven free-form deformation. In both synthetic and clinical experiments, the observed improvement in alignment of the template and target images suggest the utility of parametric eigenvector representations and hence SERg for multimodal image registration.","authors":[{"name":"Eileen  Hwuang","ids":["144995428"]},{"name":"Mirabela  Rusu","ids":["39702372"]},{"name":"Sudha  Karthigeyan","ids":["2096564344"]},{"name":"Shannon  Agner","ids":["2989257"]},{"name":"Rachel  Sparks","ids":["31640124"]},{"name":"Natalie  Shih","ids":["144072851"]},{"name":"John E.

Here, we present a review of our contribution to this interdisciplinary research field. We start by describing a simple one-step process for the synthesis of highly uniform ferrite nanoparticles (d = 20-200 nm) and their functionalization with amino acids via carboxyl groups. For real-world applications, we used admicellar polymerization to produce 200 nm diameter 'FG beads', consisting of several 40 nm diameter ferrite nanoparticles encapsulated in a co-polymer of styrene and glycidyl methacrylate for high throughput molecular screening. The highly dispersive FG beads were functionalized with an ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether spacer and used for affinity purification of methotrexate-an anti-cancer agent. We synthesized sub-100 nm diameter magnetic nanocapsules by exploiting the self-assembly of viral capsid protein pentamers, where single 8, 20, and 27 nm nanoparticles were encapsulated with VP1 pentamers for applications including MRI contrast agents. The FG beads are now commercially available for use in fully automated bio-screening systems. We also incorporated europium complexes inside a polymer matrix to produce 140 nm diameter fluorescent-ferrite beads (FF beads), which emit at 618 nm. These FF beads were used for immunofluorescent staining for diagnosis of cancer metastases to lymph nodes during cancer resection surgery by labeling tumor cell epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRs), and for the detection of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)-a hormone secreted in excess amounts by the heart when stressed-to a level of 2.0 pg ml(-1). We also describe our work on Hall biosensors made using InSb and GaAs/InGaAs/AlGaAs 2DEG heterostructures integrated with gold current strips to reduce measurement times. Our approach for the detection of sub-200 nm magnetic bead is also described: we exploit the magnetically induced capture of micrometer sized 'probe beads' by nanometer sized 'target beads', enabling the detection of small concentrations of beads as small as 8 nm in 'pumpless' microcapillary systems. Finally, we describe a 'label-less homogeneous' procedure referred to as 'magneto-optical transmission (MT) sensing', where the optical transmission of a solution containing rotating linear chains of magnetic nanobeads was used to detect biomolecules with pM-level sensitivity with a dynamic range of more than four orders of magnitude.

The first topic concerns identified patients to be treated, whereas the second is to select patients for personalized medicine. Generally, nanotechnology allows developing theranostic strategy with the same nanoparticle. Theranostics represents a new field of medicine and today it is associated with molecular imaging technologies. In reality, theranostic approach has about a history of 75 years since the use, throughout the world, of radioactive iodine for the well-established diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. It is clear that the emergence of new nanotechnologies has opened new opportunities to bring together diagnosis and tailored therapy approaches. Thus, during the past decade, it has been emerging that theranostic strategy is the best way to deliver “the right drug for the right patient at the right moment” to tackle not only cancer but to address unmet medical needs. Importantly, the development of novel imaging strategies revolutionized the nanotheranostic systems. The main multifunctional theranostic platforms are carbon-based nanomaterials, drug conjugates, aliphatic polymers, micelles, vesicles, core-shell nanoparticles, microbubbles and dendrimers bearing different contrast agents and drugs. In particular dendrimers has emerged as a new class of highly tunable hyperbranched polymers. Magnetic resonance imaging, gamma scintigraphy, computed tomography and optical imaging are the main techniques developed with dendrimers. From these basic scientific perspectives, SCIENCE CHINA Materials organized this special issue themed on “Diagnostic and Theranostic Platforms Based on Dendrimers and Hyperbranched Polymers” to review focused personalized medicines with theranostic approaches. Six very interesting reviews allow defining the frame of the use of dendrimers in the theranostic domain. From a global view, Shi et al. (https://doi.org/10.1007/ s40843-018-9271-4) report recent advances on the use of dendrimer-based systems for cancer therapy. Surface modifications of dendrimers and the application of dendrimers as versatile platforms to cancer were concerned. Majoral, Mignani and co-workers (https://doi.org/ 10.1007/s40843-018-9244-5) present the recent therapeutic applications of the theranostic principle with dendrimers in oncology, while Peng et al. (https://doi.org/ 10.1007/s40843-018-9323-6) highlight the recent progress, opportunities and challenges in developing dendrimer-based MRI contrast agents for brain tumor imaging. More focused review is from Jiang et al. (https:// doi.org/10.1007/s40843-018-9242-3) concerning the recent studies on dendrimer-based nanoparticles in cancer chemotherapy and gene therapy. This review highlights the studies of the specific controlled release of anti-cancer agents to tumor tissues and cells in a specific tumor microenvironment. Supramolecular dendritic polymers (SDPs) providing a new opportunity for the precision diagnosis and treatment of diseases have been highlighted by Zhu and co-workers (https://doi.org/10.1007/s40843018-9252-y). Majoral et al. (https://doi.org/10.1007/ s40843-018-9253-5) described a specific third-generation of diagnosis enabling the search of a broad range of pathogens with strong sensitivity and specificity. This approach is developed in the French company named Dendris. Three more specific research papers describe the use of dendrimers or dendritic polymers to tackle cancer. Luo and Gu et al. (https://doi.org/10.1007/s40843-018-9277-8) present the development of enzyme/pH-sensitive dendritic polymer-DOX conjugate for cancer treatment, whereas Chen and co-workers (https://doi.org/10.1007/ s40843-018-9238-6) detailed an original study about the simultaneous development of both tumor photothermal therapy and immunotherapy using macrophages loaded SCIENCE CHINA Materials. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

As such, there is increasing need for new concepts, technologies and imaging informatics methods to aggregate, transfer, manipulate, analyze, manage, and visualize medical data for prediction, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and research. There is a wealth of information within medical image data that is often difficult to mine effectively. One role of imaging informatics is bridging gaps between the scientific, diagnostic and therapeutic realms. This track focuses on methods for analyzing big data in medical imaging and informatics, emerging innovative imaging and informatics technologies, new research and applications of imaging informatics, and the next generation of PACS that will accommodate other imaging-rich clinical specialties and people to save their time and tension and money. Medical image processing is one of the most modern and important branch in image processing fields. Although there are many types of medical device give many variants types of medical image but still the obtained images need more and more processing to reach to optimized level to aid the surgeries to detect the infections, distortions, tumors and cancers in different human body organs. In this research, the proposed framework introduces designing and implementing of two proposals of medical images processing: First proposal deals with breast images obtained from mammography that to detect if there is any infections or distortions in each sides by using proposed comparing procedure and negative transformation and visualize the distortion area after the obtained measurements. Second proposal deals with brain images proposed to obtain by (MRI and NMI) and chest images proposed to obtain by (CT and PET) that to detect if there is a tumors in brain or cancer in chest by using sequence of modified image processing procedures begin with noise removal going to study the nature of image to detect one of two proposed image fusion techniques then visualize the fused image which display the tumors and cancers much more clearly.","authors":[{"name":"a Gopal Reddy","ids":["153232385"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["96f1e06795d99fbff4180b16dc2a8f91cfb558e1","a73d23988e854cb1d74c62f9d5af7589da56f70c","a22863b651c98eb607f9f644abe940c98dc4b569","7831fe5c58a7dc29867af18f2c1d84cbb64e0493","705c3207c283ce786d6a47390553d80b9247955a","e09940f7eb6bab53ab196e565816196655401aa9","919209c7c3a8dd7547c05cc8cf22ad5b53aa11a7"],"year":2017,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/23881973c0dbd0b4230f407b82f44f1e859cd8be","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.icci-sem.com/public/images/author_documents/67370_IIRAJ-CISEM-BSR-1819217-404.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"9","journalPages":"53-58","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"magId":"2969036945","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"ec3e8a7f818bfca7ba7f88149defe5b4e3264de6","title":"A statistical deformation model (SDM) based regularizer for non-rigid image registration: application to registration of multimodal prostate MRI and histology","paperAbstract":"Free form deformation (FFD) is a popular algorithm for non-linear image registration because of its ability to accurately recover deformations. However, due to the unconstrained nature of elastic registration, FFD may introduce unrealistic deformations, especially when differences between template and target image are large, thereby necessitating a regularizer to constrain the registration to a physically meaning transformation. Prior knowledge in the form of a Statistical Deformation Model (SDM) in a registration scheme has been shown to function as an effective regularizer. With a similar underlying premise, in this paper, we present a novel regularizer for FFD that leverages knowledge of known, valid deformations to train a statistical deformation model (SDM). At each iteration of the FFD registration, the SDM is utilized to calculate the likelihood of a given deformation occurring and appropriately influence the similarity metric to limit the registration to only realistic deformations. We quantitatively evaluate robustness of the SDM regularizer in the framework of FFD through a set of synthetic experiments using brain images with a range of induced deformations and 3 types of multiplicative noise - Gaussian, salt and pepper and speckle. We demonstrate that FFD with the inclusion of the SDM regularizer yields up to a 19% increase in normalized cross correlation (NCC) and a 16% decrease in root mean squared (RMS) error and mean absolute distance (MAD). Registration performance was also evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in spatially aligning ex vivo pseudo whole mount histology (WMH) sections and in vivo prostate MRI in order to map the spatial extent of prostate cancer (CaP) onto corresponding radiologic imaging. Across all evaluation measures (MAD, RMS, and DICE), regularized FFD performed significantly better compared to unregularized FFD.","authors":[{"name":"Srivathsan Babu Prabu","ids":["41069333"]},{"name":"Robert  Toth","ids":["144141258"]},{"name":"Anant  Madabhushi","ids":["1705442"]}],"inCitations":["af50b4cfa8aac5f45c7ecda05301c09d1777085f","44339d24ebffef211621611bf18ce941bdbcc027","7c9113041066be3fad57c3ffd33f9967b0946249","8f43742d95d31e2d7f7dd9764856c0e80f064775","28be2bbad6e68d5db8dfee0cb0aa2da14b3ef764"],"outCitations":["bce195e675abbc96bcce379e99a47a884ca9cb57","5ada8ff52246a181c1e4e449515b0a7e83373f2d","fb934a7492c045c28dcd8da0336203af18be5cde","fc9d06952c5f8e5a1911ff15b00a9be08d88745d","37dce700964865c15069d6f65ea1f82406968129","4fa429b73c471ddc1f67e7f75fb3d038ccb0e8ee","83ac94dcaee2680c86dcd094f0b87a77e56f8f9e","9663e443374969fd8666428794f23d38c6b7f957","186050bcbecc5a8f2caa76ae9d283bd7bb2c283d","d5b692f690207d59fd21b19c4a510fd7c3f6caa8","3a05135cdd641295c38e91765472d46c1adb407c","f731b6745d829241941307c3ebf163e90e200318","f3147464d48d1d1cdd7bf5688d3ede76e2762c26","bf2c271c95759b412d65e454b12a9aefd1d1db4e","d13e43b06ace8cbdad595c0780553a4ad304340d","6b0771a9b0393fb806acf90cde73c256ec5f5945","f78a44a7b4c8daad92668da77f7090a1b7b347df","8424cf5a8c41c589d5739021c682a6494c033916","0fd740e59e4e6b26064652697d42030fca86e78b","3a4df201c7fe30b22e03d5ac0180acc345ee559a","1b41d42e5c37e61d8ddfffcb2356c9049b68d092","c280849b65e1477764bf150c75d0474d0fa49eb0","fadcf962897d4b72c99af8e9c048c7a8066046bb","eeaf10c9031f06122296cd0b0091872871462fa8"],"year":2013,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ec3e8a7f818bfca7ba7f88149defe5b4e3264de6","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://engineering.case.edu/centers/ccipd/sites/ccipd.case.edu/files/publications/Sri-SDM.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2008707"],"venue":"Medical Imaging","journalName":"","journalVolume":"8676","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1117/12.2008707","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2008707","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Engineering"],"magId":"1974246648","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"427f7c71fa0037d896af42e99b56ad0ec023f087","title":"A Novel Method for Objective Selection of Information Sources Using Multi-Kernel SVM and Local Scaling","paperAbstract":"Advancement on computer and sensing technologies has generated exponential growth in the data available for the development of systems that support decision-making in fields such as health, entertainment, manufacturing, among others. This fact has made that the fusion of data from multiple and heterogeneous sources became one of the most promising research fields in machine learning. However, in real-world applications, to reduce the number of sources while maintaining optimal system performance is an important task due to the availability of data and implementation costs related to processing, implementation, and development times. In this work, a novel method for the objective selection of relevant information sources in a multimodality system is proposed. This approach takes advantage of the ability of multiple kernel learning (MKL) and the support vector machines (SVM) classifier to perform an optimal fusion of data by assigning weights according to their discriminative value in the classification task; when a kernel is designed for representing each data source, these weights can be used as a measure of their relevance. Moreover, three algorithms for tuning the Gaussian kernel bandwidth in the classifier prediction stage are introduced to reduce the computational cost of searching for an optimal solution; these algorithms are an adaptation of a common technique in unsupervised learning named local scaling. Two real application tasks were used to evaluate the proposed method: the selection of electrodes for a classification task in Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) systems and the selection of relevant Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences for detection of breast cancer. The obtained results show that the proposed method allows the selection of a small number of information sources.","authors":[{"name":"Henry Jhoán Areiza-Laverde","ids":["1390007280"]},{"name":"Andrés Eduardo Castro-Ospina","ids":["1390007388"]},{"name":"Liliana  Hernández","ids":["2057511484"]},{"name":"Gloria M.

The goal of the feature selection algorithms is to separate out a little set of informative options that best explains experimental variations. This work really investigates the feature selection drawback for microarray information with tiny samples and variant correlation. Most existing algorithms sometimes need expensive machine effort, particularly beneath thousands of cistron (Gene) conditions. Usually citron (Gene) selection methodology searches for associate best or close to best set of genes with relevance a given analysis. Methods: The main objective of this project is to effectively choose the foremost informative options from microarray data, whereas creating the machine expenses reasonable. This can be achieved by proposing Fuzzy Forest using Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) that makes use of interaction between the features (or Genes). Necessary representative features (or Genes) selection measure designated from every enriched feature partition to make the reduced gene area. Findings: Finally, by shaping a correct regression context, the planned methodology are often simply implement to utilize the MapReduce paradigm, that considerably reduces machine load and additionally resulting in lower prediction error rates (OOB) with variable importance compared to different existing approaches. Thus, it is necessary to know the performance of random forest with microarray data and its potential use for gene selection. Applications: Some the major applications of WGCNA based Fuzzy Forest are genomic data analysis (including microarray data), neuroscience, bioinformatics, DNA methylation data analysis (16s rRNA gene sequencing), cancer, yeast genetics analysis, analysis of brain imaging data (functional MRI data analysis).","authors":[{"name":"L.

In more recent years, the use of technology and computers has turned the field around with a myriad of algorithms and imaging tools. On one side of the development are novel acquisition technologies that provide a new or improved way of acquiring data-sets from different specimens, from cells in petri dishes, to animals, to humans. On the other side, there are new techniques to interpret or assist the interpretation of the conditions inherent in those data-sets. This special issue concentrates on the latter, namely the tools and technologies that enable the understanding and analysis of medical images. Despite a considerable number of years of research, the field is still open for development as is demonstrated by several conferences that focus on the area. This issue of Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering: Imaging & Visualization (CMBBE:I&V) presents a collection of selected work presented at the Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) (Reyes-Aldasoro & Slabaugh 2014) conference that was organised by City University London and held in London in July 2014. This conference has been hosted at different locations in the United Kingdom, and whilst it began as a national conference, it now attracts delegates from nearly every continent. For this issue, extended papers were requested from the authors with top-scoring submissions. The papers went under the standard CMBBE:I&V peer review and revisions prior to publication. The six papers that form this special issue represent the variety of image acquisition techniques, which include phase-contrast microscopy, in vitro optical projection tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical mapping. In terms of the application, these papers deal with cancer, cardiology, Alzheimer’s disease and microscopy, which can be applied in different areas of biomedicine. Despite the lack of contrast that is provided by phasecontrast microscopy, it remains a popular acquisition technique that avoids detrimental tagging effects of fluorescence microscopy. Jaccard et al. present a segmentation algorithm that can discriminate cells from a background using local histograms and random forest classifiers. The work of Zhang and co-authors is of great interest in the area of colon cancer, as it explores the morphology of the surface of excised colorectal polyps with a multi-scale approach and the use of level sets method. Also on the area of cancer, Bakas et al. describe a segmentation algorithm applied to focal liver lesions observed through a contrast-enhanced ultrasound acquisition. The problem of a complete and reliable set of cardiac planes acquired with MRI is approached by Margeta and co-authors. They propose a methodology based on convolutional neural networks and classification forests that addresses noise and missing DICOM information. The analysis of the variability of the hippocampus on patients with Alzheimer’s disease is presented by Cury et al. who investigate the shapes through the deformation of templates with diffeomorphic techniques. Finally, Yu and co-authors present the use of optical mapping as a tool to assess cardiac electrophysiology. This manuscript describes both the techniques to isolate and observe a murine heart and the algorithms to perform the analysis of the data. We trust that this special issue will provide a snapshot of the interesting work presented at MIUA 2014 and thus help attract high-quality submissions to future MIUA conferences.","authors":[{"name":"Constantino Carlos Reyes-Aldasoro","ids":["1393643655"]},{"name":"Gregory G.

It is critical to the advancement of imaging-based medical research, for example, using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to probe brain structural and functional changes related to a disease or cognitive process. \n \nThis special issue highlights new methods of signal and image processing, computer vision, machine learning, and statistical analysis and their application in medical image analysis. It is organized into two groups of papers: predictive modeling and image processing. \n \nIn the first group, we include a set of papers for imaging-derived biomarker detection and clinical decision support systems. The overall theme is how to detect biomarkers characterizing a disease and to build decision support systems using computer algorithms. B. Tay et al. propose a classification scheme for identifying healthy individuals and patients with spinal cord injuries based on fractional anisotropy values obtained from diffusion tensor imaging data. H. Liu et al. address cirrhosis classification based on multimodality imaging and propose a new method to extract texture features for multilabel classification (normal, early, middle, and advanced stages). G.-P. Liu et al. employ deep learning and multilabel learning to construct the syndrome diagnostic model for chronic gastritis. M. Yang et al. describe a method to automatically detect corticospinal tract damage in chronic stroke patients and demonstrate that the detected biomarker is associated with motor impairment. Y.

This gives them a good idea where they are in the patients’ anatomy but doesn’t provide information about the type of tissue they are dissecting. In this paper we demonstrate an integrated system consisting of a spatially navigated surgical electrocautery combined with real-time molecular analysis of the dissected tissue using mass spectrometry. METHODS: Using the 3D Slicer software package, we have integrated a commercially available neurosurgical navigation system with an intra-operative mass spectrometer (colloquially referred to as the intelligent knife, or iKnife) that analyzes the charged ions in the smoke created during cauterization. We demonstrate this system using a simulated patient comprised of an MRI scan from a brain cancer patient deformably registered to a plastic skull model. On the skull model we placed porcine and bovine tissues to simulate cancerous and healthy tissue, respectively. We built a PCA/LDA model to distinguish between these tissue types. The tissue classifications were displayed in a spatially localized manner in the pre-operative imaging, in both 2D and 3D views. RESULTS: We have demonstrated the feasibility of performing spatially navigated intra-operative analysis of tissues by mass spectrometry. We show that machine learning can classify our sample tissues, with an average computed confidence of 99.37 % for porcine tissue and 99.36% for bovine tissue. CONCLUSION: In this paper we demonstrate a proof of concept system for navigated intra-operative molecular analysis. This system may enable intra-operative awareness of spatially localized tissue classification during dissection, information that is especially useful in tumor surgeries where margins may not be visible to the unassisted eye.","authors":[{"name":"Mark  Asselin","ids":["49332398"]},{"name":"Martin  Kaufmann","ids":["8930252"]},{"name":"Julia  Wiercigroch","ids":["88955477"]},{"name":"Tamas  Ungi","ids":["2202160"]},{"name":"Andras  Lasso","ids":["2753543"]},{"name":"John  Rudan","ids":["38205713"]},{"name":"Gabor  Fichtinger","ids":["1983720"]}],"inCitations":["34e50c8cfa92f9c9911121879bedcc61c3d20b85"],"outCitations":["f6734a6c080525a53cb1f900969116fa4da7284a","e4e71a6578466f92104ce41d0143ee96ab89522b","092090162e0f9bc707ce13363caffd9330aaa076","d2072d612fd9c5304a4d45bbd879f1949aec6646","ca5e2158e3901ac9cd88e0ccaec6b950cfdeccef","37e173fe493a6e76c3cd026e2861ecead46a1592","2f8a99c67e187b7d451e8acf5ea6038f02e3442d","67da8732e93c4c4fd78495d80001bd901212d8b7","af4ef4660d6d6919319bd3fb802c7fbafa55b4d0","c6db2dec6b75df733fbe38701cbe952411a8fb8a","0d31b431d26c71a8a561af92dce28ac1f8aa8626"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/462f5e4743546a3f69d09957b8799fcc94a057ee","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2512586"],"venue":"Medical Imaging","journalName":"","journalVolume":"10951","journalPages":"109512C - 109512C-7","doi":"10.1117/12.2512586","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2512586","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Engineering"],"magId":"2921571136","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"3966ceba37745db3c9b8ded92f3df5097a4cf33f","title":"WE‐D‐330A‐02: Optical‐Computed‐and Emmission Tomography: Applications in Cancer Research","paperAbstract":"Purpose: This work explores the potential of optical‐computed and emission‐tomography (OCT/OET), when coupled with optical clearing techniques, for imaging aspects of biological structure and function for cancer research. OCT/OET are the optical analogues to x‐ray‐CT and SPECT respectively, and can yield high resolution high contrast 3D images of a variety of inherent or applied absorbing and fluorescing stains. Materials and Methods Several methods of staining tissue have been explored and applied to a range of tissue types. Xenograph tumor microvasculature was labeled with both passive absorbing stain and fluorescing active probes (e.g. lectin conjugated with FITC) by tail vein injection. Murine vasculature in major organs(lung,heart, brain) were stained with absorbing dye in a similar manner. OCT/OET imaging was performed using an in‐house custom built scanner. Isotropic 3D transmision and emission data were reconstructed using tomographic algorithms from equiangularly spaced projection images. Results: Isotropic high resolution 3D image data of the xenograph tumor showed extensive peripheral microvasculature with the occasional larger vessels penetrating to the tumor core. High‐quality 3D images of the lungs were achieved showing clear differences in perfusion between irradiated and unirradiated lung regions. Exquisite high contrastimages were acquired of the vasculature and myocardial perfusion of the murine heart.Conclusion Primary advantages of OCT/OET include the preservation of tissue structure in 3D (tissue sectioning is not required), and the ability to acquire co‐registered images of both structure (e.g.micro‐vasculature) and function (e.g. perfusion, gene expression). Higher spatial resolution and higher contrast is achieved when compared with alternative modalities like micro‐CT and micro‐MRI. The techniques are versatile as imaging can be performed on a wide variety of absorbing and fluorescing stains.","authors":[{"name":"Mark  Oldham","ids":["1848871"]},{"name":"H  Sakhalkar","ids":["5617507"]},{"name":"Tim  Oliver","ids":["97170389"]},{"name":"Mark W.

With the development of medical diagnosis, such as ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), automatic control, imaging processing and electrical technology, extracorporeal and intrarectal HIFU systems have been developed for clinical trials since the middle of 1990s. Available targets include: prostate, pancreatic, liver, kidney, brain, bone, breast cancers and uterine fibroids. In Asia and Europe more than 100,000 patients have been involved with promising results. In comparison to conventional open surgery, radioor chemo-therapy, HIFU has the advantages of non-invasiveness, non-ionization, few complications, easy recoveries and potentially infinite number of sessions [1,2]. HIFU was selected by TIME magazine as one of the 50 most inspired ideas, innovations and revolutions of 2011 [3]. The principle of HIFU is that the absorption of acoustic energy by the internal tissue leads to the temperature elevation over 65oC to denature the protein in the solid tumor/cancer for the generation of coagulative necrosis. The beam size of HIFU is usually 1-2 mm in the lateral and 1 cm in the axial directions, respectively. The boundary between apparently totally disrupted cells and normal tissue is no more than 50 μm in width. No damage on the intervening tissue (i.e., artery, nerve and skin surface) is found in the clinics if acoustic coupling is kept good during the ablation. Since the major mechanism of HIFU is the thermal effect, accurate and real-time temperature monitoring at the HIFU focal region is of importance for the efficacy and efficiency in clinical HIFU application as well as the medical device approval by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of United States.","authors":[{"name":"Yufeng  Zhou","ids":["33954255"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["47cc39b9eaa497bdab4cb5712ec35e7ad6e2fd97","7482918393e265d67867cf48df7bb9391f1b4741","2418932329623f5872020006149da0c7d14cdb8b","1677e0eb06ce7729c0f173f64d93e9cc0e07b710","438b3db2c6288b70031c1f1615ef5bdd50dddbc7","ca1778b1491eccc0022c600bcfe76749dbc54a20","0ef65480cef06c598bd8f29d643efbd958f41e19","9035b986f85e699f51e3a472029d890eaeb9bae9","6797e0ae832b1ab07021c6dc7d4565c2d4631b23","67e1dd4a4425ca21d9b5e2d2332057ce75e5fc7e"],"year":2012,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/33eb577d0319123efda1dc41c05c813816137007","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/yfzhou/Publications/thermography%20in%20HIFU%20ablation.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"Journal of Applied Mechanical Engineering","journalVolume":"2012","journalPages":"","doi":"10.4172/2168-9873.1000E101","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4172/2168-9873.1000E101","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"2321848902","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"c5a94787798d40572ba3ee622cc0da74b5907891","title":"A THREE-PHASE INDUCTIVE SENSOR FOR IN VIVO MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICAL ANISOTROPY OF BIOLOGICAL TISSUES","paperAbstract":"Biological tissue will have anisotropy in electrical conductivity, due to the orientation of muscular fibers or neural axons as well as the distribution of large size blood vessels. Thus, the in vivo measurement of electrical conductivity anisotropy can be used to detect deep-seated vessels in large organs such as the liver during surgeries. For diagnostic applications, decrease of anisotropy may indicate the existence of cancer in anisotropic tissues such as the white matter of the brain or the mammary gland in the breast. In this paper, we will introduce a new tri-phase induction method to drive rotating high-frequency electrical current in the tissue for the measurement of electrical conductivity anisotropy. In the measurement, three electromagnets are symmetrically placed on the tissue surface and driven by high-frequency alternative currents of  0 kHz, modulated  with 1 kHz 3-phase signals. In the center area of three magnets, magnetic fields are superimposed to produce a rotating induction current. This current produces electrical potentials among circularly arranged electrodes to be used to find the conductivity in each direction determined by the electrode pairs. To find the horizontal and vertical signal components, the measured potentials are amplified by a 2ch lock-in amplifier phase-locked with the 1 kHz reference signal. The superimposed current in the tissue was typically 45 micro Amperes when we applied 150 micro Tesla of magnetic field. We showed the validity of our method by conducting in vitro measurements with respect to artificially formed anisotropic materials and preliminary in vivo measurements on the pig’s liver. Compared to diffusion tensor MRI method, our anisotropy sensor is compact and advantageous for use during surgical operations because our method does not require strong magnetic field that may disturb ongoing surgical operations.","authors":[{"name":"Yukio  Kosugi","ids":["10165225"]},{"name":"Tadashi  Takemae","ids":["34506412"]},{"name":"Hiroki  Takeshima","ids":["91951556"]},{"name":"Atsushi  Kudo","ids":["94650460"]},{"name":"Kazuyuki  Kojima","ids":["145973622"]},{"name":"Naofumi  Tanaka","ids":["48272355"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["7677e5c1a58bf2c3b63348f49198e8b7006fbaa0","d24d5931b966921210848eaebacd30c85b212ab5","ff540b94a6f8820192049365cc0df95f6c9b4c47"],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c5a94787798d40572ba3ee622cc0da74b5907891","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://savremenimaterijali.info/sajt/doc/file/casopisi/5_1/1kosugi.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"Contemporary materials","journalVolume":"1","journalPages":"1-9","doi":"10.7251/CM.V1I5.1492","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7251/CM.V1I5.1492","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"99521832","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"b4a74fef72c1d331bfc397e0623d0c065ea2d57b","title":"Simulation of patient-specific glioma models for therapy planning. (Simulation de modèles personnalisés de gliomes pour la planification de thérapies)","paperAbstract":"Tumor growth models based on the Fisher Kolmogorov (FK) reaction-diffusion equation have shown convincing results in reproducing and predicting the invasion patterns of glioma brain tumors. In this thesis we use different FK model formulations to i) assess the need of patient-specific DTIs when modeling LGGs, ii) study cancer cell infiltration after tumor resections, and iii) define a metric to determine progressive disease for low-grade glimoas (LGG).Diffusion tensor images (DTIs) have been suggested to model the anisotropic diffusion of tumor cells in brain white matter. However, patient specific DTIs are expensive and often acquired with low resolution, which compromises the accuracy of the tumor growth models' results. We used a FK formulation to describe the evolution of the visible boundary of the tumor to investigate the impact of replacing the patient DTI by i) an isotropic diffusion map or ii) an anisotropic high-resolution DTI atlas formed by averaging the DTIs of multiple patients. We quantify the impact of replacing the patient DTI using synthetic tumor growth simulations and tumor evolution predictions on a clinical case. This study suggests that modeling glioma growth with tissue based differential motility (not using a DTI) yields slightly less accurate results than using a DTI. However, refraining from using a DTI would be sufficient in situations when modeling LGGs. Therefore, any of these DTI options are valid to use in a FK formulation to model LGG growth with the purpose of aiding clinicians in therapy planning.After a brain resection medical professionals want to know what the best type of follow-up treatment would be for a particular patient, i.e., chemotherapy for diffuse tumors or a second resection after a given amount of time for bulky tumors. We propose a thorough method to leverage FK reaction-diffusion glioma growth models on post-operative cases showing brain distortions to estimate tumor cell infiltration beyond the visible boundaries in FLAIR MRIs. Our method addresses two modeling challenges: i) the challenge of brain parenchyma movement after surgery with a non-linear registration technique and ii) the challenge of incomplete post-operative tumor segmentations by combining two infiltration maps, where one was simulated from a pre-operative image and one estimated from a post-operative image. We used the data of two patients with LGG to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed three-step method. We believe that our proposed method could help clinicians anticipate tumor regrowth after a resection and better characterize the radiological non-visible infiltrative extent of a tumor to plan therapy.For LGGs captured on FLAIR/T2 MRIs, there is a substantial amount debate on selecting a definite threshold for size-based metrics to determine progressive disease (PD) and it is still an open item for the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group. We propose an approach to assess PD of LGG using tumor growth speed estimates from a FK formulation that takes into consideration irregularities in tumor shape, differences in growth speed between gray matter and white matter, and volumetric changes. Using the FLAIR MRIs of nine patients we compare the PD estimates of our proposed approach to i) the ones calculated using 1D, 2D, and 3D manual tumor growth speed estimates and ii) the ones calculated using a set of well-established size-based criteria (RECIST, Macdonald, and RANO). We conclude from our comparison results that our proposed approach is promising for assessing PD of LGG from a limited number of MRI scans. It is our hope that this model's tumor growth speed estimates could one day be used as another parameter in clinical therapy planning.","authors":[{"name":"Erin

adults: comparison with conventional autopsy","paperAbstract":"Sir: Paranoia abounds when a ‘new’ technology is identified that may replace a job traditionally performed by humans, rendering those individuals redundant. Will the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other similar imaging technologies replace the need for full invasive autopsies of all types, thus finally confining the autopsy to the memoirs of retired pathologists? The paper by Roberts et al. would suggest that this is not the case, although we wish to draw to the attention of your readers a number of observations that this paper has prompted. The authors are correct in stating that this is the first study of non-suspicious sudden adult deaths to assess the use of MRI in establishing the cause of death. However, this is not the case for forensic or paediatric autopsies, or for the post mortem examination of head and neck structures. Thali et al. published a highly illustrated series of 40 forensic cases in which they compared the findings of both multislice computed tomography (MSCT) and MRI with full invasive examination, illustrating the wider application of these technologies in autopsy practice. Rather than restricting their study to the question of the cause of death, the authors also explored the use of MSCT and MRI for the assessment of trauma (soft tissue, skeletal and visceral), vital reaction and forensic reconstruction. The article highlighted how these technologies can both supplement and enhance the autopsy examination and, in 55%, could have replaced autopsy examination altogether. Other studies have also highlighted the potential use of MSCT for the identification of an unknown individual, one of the principal questions of the coroner’s remit (who, where, when and how). We routinely use a variety of imaging techniques, including plain X-ray, fluoroscopy, MSCT and MRI, the latter being reserved for paediatric cases and the former three used depending on the questions posed. These days, for adults, the use of MSCT has now almost entirely replaced the use of plain X-rays as, with one hour’s notice, we have access to the hospital CT scanner, 24 h per day, 7 days per week. The on-call radiographers are trained in the use of the technology and the bodies need not be removed from the sealed body bags, thus providing advantages over traditional forms of radiography. As in the abovementioned papers, a full-body trauma scan can be undertaken in a matter of minutes with more detailed reconstruction scans undertaken for areas of interest, the cost of the radiological examination being much less than that quoted by Roberts et al. The forensic pathologist is present during the examination to review the scans and discuss the findings, although, to date, a radiologist continues to report the films formally. The autopsies are then performed immediately after the imaging. Has the MSCT or MRI replaced the need for an autopsy—in our opinion, no. The commonest cause of adult death in the UK, according to the paper by Roberts, can still not be diagnosed with sufficient accuracy to replace the neccessity for an autopsy. If stenosis of the coronary arteries is identified on the images, is this necessarily the cause of death? Even supplementing the image with a clinical history and an external examination of the body may still not adequately remove the need for an autopsy. The MRI cannot diagnose inborn errors of metabolism, conductive abnormality or toxicological deaths. In fact, with regard to the latter possibility, the identification of coronary artery atheroma on a scan following the nonsuspicious death of an elderly adult, could actually lead to a misdiagnosis. However, we agree that these techniques have a significant role in modern autopsy practice, including the identification of cause of death, such as traumatic brain injury or disseminated cancer, or the revealing of an unexpected finding which may or may not be related to the ultimate cause of death, e.g. packets of drugs within the gastrointestinal tract of a drug ‘mule’ (Figure 1). Imaging may identify the location of a projectile within the body (Figure 2) and, using reconstruction, show the path of the passage through the body soft tissues. Finally, it may answer a specific question, for example, is there a cardiac air embolus in a person who has suffered neck trauma (Figure 3). As Roberts et al. mention, the images can be stored in an electronic format for review at a later date or use in court long after the body has been disposed of. Is it necessary, therefore, to continue to a full formal examination? The answer is no; however, the courts at present still request full examinations for evidence. In the future this may not always be the case. Secondary pathology or post mortem changes are also often revealed during these imaging examinations.

The atrophy/loss of brain structure as seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is strongly correlated with the severity of the cognitive impairment in AD. In this paper, we set out to find associations between predefined regions of the brain (regions of interest; ROIs) and the severity of the disease. Specifically, we use these associations to address two important issues in AD: (i) typical versus atypical atrophy patterns and (ii) the origin and direction of progression of atrophy, which is currently under debate.\n We observed that each AD-related ROI is associated with a wide range of severity and that the difference between ROIs is merely a difference in severity distribution. To model differences between the severity distribution of a subpopulation (with significant atrophy in certain ROIs) and the severity distribution of the entire population, we developed the concept of Distributional Association Rules. Using the Distributional Association Rules, we clustered ROIs into disease subsystems. We define a disease subsystem as a contiguous set of ROIs that are collectively implicated in AD. AD is known to be heterogeneous in the sense that multiple sets of ROIs may be related to the disease in a population. We proposed an enhancement to the association rule mining where the algorithm only discovers association rules with ROIs that form an approximately contiguous volume. Next, we applied these association rules to infer the direction of disease progression based on the support measures of the association rules. We also developed a novel statistical test to determine the statistical significance of the discovered direction.\n We evaluated the proposed method on the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) prospective patient cohorts. The key achievements of the methodology is that it accurately identified larger disease subsystems implicated in typical and atypical AD and it successfully mapped the directions of disease progression.\n The wealth of data available in Radiology gives rise to opportunities for applying this methodology to map out the trajectory of several other diseases, e.g. other neuro-degenerative diseases and cancers, most notably, breast cancer. The applicability of this method is not limited to image data, as associating predictors with severity provides valuable information in most areas of medicine as well as other industries.","authors":[{"name":"György J.

The most notable is the blanket of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation, largely microwave radiation generated for wireless communication and surveillance technologies, as mounting scientific evidence suggests that prolonged exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation has serious biological and health effects. However, public exposure regulations in most countries continue to be based on the guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which were established in the 1990s on the belief that only acute thermal effects are hazardous. Prevention of tissue heating by radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation is now proven to be ineffective in preventing biochemical and physiological interference. For example, acute non-thermal exposure has been shown to alter human brain metabolism by NIH scientists, electrical activity in the brain, and systemic immune responses. Chronic exposure has been associated with increased oxidative stress and DNA damage and cancer risk. Laboratory studies, including large rodent studies by the US National Toxicology Program and Ramazzini Institute of Italy, confirm these biological and health effects in vivo. As we address the threats to human health from the changing environmental conditions due to human activity, the increasing exposure to artificial electromagnetic radiation needs to be included in this discussion. Due to the exponential increase in the use of wireless personal communication devices (eg, mobile or cordless phones and WiFi or Bluetooth-enabled devices) and the infrastructure facilitating them, levels of exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation around the 1 GHz frequency band, which is mostly used for modern wireless communications, have increased from extremely low natural levels by about 1018 times (figure). Radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation is also used for radar, security scanners, smart meters, and medical equipment (MRI, diathermy, and radiofrequency ablation). It is plausibly the most rapidly increasing anthropogenic environmental exposure since the mid20th century, and levels will surge considerably again, as technologies like the Internet of Things and 5G add millions more radiofrequency transmitters around us. Unprecedented human exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation from conception until death has been occurring in the past two decades. Evidence of its effects on the CNS, including altered neurodevelopment and increased risk of some neurodegenerative diseases, is a major concern considering the steady increase in their incidence.

As healthcare moves toward the personalized medicine paradigm, it is becoming increasingly apparent that real-time feedback control strategies are needed to guide and monitor the delivery of therapies as well. The development of feedback control systems in healthcare will require not just improvements in imaging instrumentation, but also the advent of theranostic agents that can report on and manipulate conditions in vivo. Theranostic biocolloids are needed that can both measure and actuate therapeutic processes. Thus, the field of soft matter colloids is rapidly integrating with the radiological and pharmaceutical fields to add a vast new array of theranostic tools. Theranostic biocolloids are nano- and micro-metric particles which can be injected into the patient for both imaging and therapy. Often, these particles are formed by the directed assembly of biomolecules, imaging tags and active pharmaceutical ingredients, and so a solid foundation in colloid science is necessary. \n \nThere appears to be an endless supply of possible combinations of biomolecules (such as lipids, proteins, sugars and nucleic acids) and biocompatible synthetic compounds (such as polymers, dendrimers, fluorocarbons and metal chelators) to form theranostic colloidal constructs. The enormous library of materials and methods available to generate biocolloids provides unparalleled flexibility; biocolloids can be engineered to carry almost any therapeutic payload and to be detected by any imaging modality. Biocolloids have been engineered as contrast agents for ultrasound, photoacoustic imaging, optical tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), x-ray computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET). Additionally, soft matter colloids have been loaded with pharmaceutical agents to increase their therapeutic index. Combining these functionalities, theranostic biocolloids open the possibility of image-guided therapy, allowing the realization of real-time measurement, monitoring and manipulation of drug targeting. \n \nWe are pleased to present this special issue on theranostic biocolloids. We start with several articles on soft nanoparticles. First, Luk et al. review recent work on lipid and polymer nanostructures for cancer theranostics 1. Menon et al. then present a novel nanoemulsion for dual modality MRI/fluorescence imaging for oximetry 2. Finally, Vu et al. discuss an innovative theranostic polymer library for transgene delivery to cancer cells 3. The issue then moves to several articles on theranostic microbubbles. First, Owen et al. describe a fascinating new magnetic microbubble formulation 4. Kwan et al. then describe a novel theranostic oxygen delivery system 5. Wrenn et al. review the current state of microbubble acoustical modeling and a novel “nested bubble” theranostic strategy 6. Matsunaga et al. review recent work on phase-change nanodroplets 7. Sirsi and Borden review microbubbles used for gene therapy 8.

Functionalized gadolinium-loaded fullerenes attracted much attention as a potential new nanoplatform for next-generation magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, given their inherent higher H relaxivity than most commercial contrast agents. The fullerene cage is an extraordinarily stable species which makes it extremely unlikely to break and release the toxic Gd metal ions into the bioenvironment. In addition, radiolabeled metals could be encapsulated in this robust carbon cage to deliver therapeutic irradiation. In this dissertation, we aim to develop a series of functionalized TNTEMFs for MRI detection of various pathological conditions, such as brain cancer, chronic osteomyelitis, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. As a general introduction, Chapter 1 briefly introduces recent progress in developing metallofullerenes for next-generation biomedical applications. Of special interest are MRI contrast agents. Other potential biomedical applications, toxicity, stability and biodistribution of metallofullerenes are also discussed. Finally, the challenges and future outlook of using fullerene in biomedical and diagnosis applications are summarized at the end of this chapter. The large carbon surface area is ideally suited for multiple exo-functionalization approaches to modify the hydrophobic fullerene cage for a more hydrophilic bio-environment. Additionally, peptides and other agents are readily covalently attached to this nanoprobe for targeting applications. Chapter 2 presents the functionalized metallofullerenes conjugated with interleukin13 peptide exhibits enhanced targeting of U-251 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines and can be effectively delivered intravenously in an orthotopic GBM mouse model. Chapter 3 shows, with the specific targeting moiety, the functionalized metallofullerenes can be applied as a noninvasive imaging approach to detect and differentiate chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis from aseptic inflammation. Fullerene is a powerful antioxidant due to delocalization of the π-electrons over the carbon cage, which can readily react with free radicals and subsequently delivers a cascade of downstream possessions in numerous biomedical applications. Chapter 4 investigates the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of functionalized Gd3N@C80. This nanoplatform would hold great promise as a novel class of theranostic agent in combating oxidative stress and resolving inflammation, given their inherent MRI applications. In chapter 5, Gd3N@C80 is modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for working as MRI contrast agents for GI tract. The high molecular weight can prevent any appreciable absorption through the skin or mucosal tissue, and offer considerable advantages for localized agents in the GI tract. Besides the excellent contrast capability, the PEGylated-Gd3N@C80 exhibits outstanding radical scavenging ability, which can potentially eliminate the reactive oxygen species in GI tract. The biodistribution result suggests this nanoplatform can be worked as the potential contrast agent for GI tract at least for 6 hours. A novel amphiphilic Gd3N@C80 derivative is discussed in Chapter 6. It has been noticed for a long time the functionalization Gd3N@C80 contrast agents have higher relaxivity at lower concentrations. The explanation for the concentration dependency is not fully understood. In this work, the amphiphilic Gd3N@C80 derivative is used as the model to investigate the relationship between the relaxivity and concentration of the Gd-based fullerenes. Click chemistry has been extensively used in functionalization due to the high efficiency and technical simplicity of the reaction. Appendix A describes a new type of Sc3N@C80 derivative conducted by employing the click reaction. The structure of Sc3N@C80-alkynyl and Sc3N@C80alkynyl-benzyl azide are characterized by NMR, MALDI-TOF, UV-Vis, and HPLC. The high yield of the click reaction can provide access to various derivatives which have great potential for application in medical and materials science. The functionalization and characterizations of Ho3N@C80 derivatives are reported in Appendix B. The contrast ability of Ho3N@C80 is directly compared with Gd3N@C80. The Ho-based fullerenes can be performed as the radiotherapeutic agents; the leaching study is performed to test the stability of carbon cage after irradiation. Appendix C briefly shows a new method to develop Gd3N@C80 based targeting platform, which can be used as the probe for chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis.

Advancements in imaging technology and image informatics have facilitated and enabled quantitative understanding of the biological structures, functional organisms, and pathological mechanisms. This special issue presents 14 latest research contributions in computational biomedical imaging. The focuses have been on the computational principles, strategies, methods, and algorithms that create, extract, and understand imaging data of biomedical significance. The first group of papers has showcased the development and applications of rigorous optimization techniques in biomedical imaging. The work based on dual unscented Kalman filtering provides a reliable and efficient platform to understand the BOLD signals from fMRI. In the other paper, the robust discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to solve the branch-cut phase unwrapping problem of MRI data. Without the need for a regularization penalty term, a semigreed method for bioluminescence tomography reconstruction is fast and stable for small animal imaging. The second group of papers has addressed image segmentation and tissue characterization problems, ever popular among image analysis researchers. The work of L. Li et al. applies machine learning techniques to characterize lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer from gemstone spectral imaging with much improved outcomes, while G. V. Sanchez. Ferrero et al. make new advances in ultrasonic speckle characterization using generalized Gama distribution and generalized Gama mixture model. In recent years, physically meaningful modeling and simulation have become integral components for modelconstrained imaging and model-based image understanding. Thus, the third group of papers has continued the stride in this direction. The propagation of myocardial electrical activation is simulated using a monodomain model, without the need of explicit mesh constraints. In similar spirit, one work performs forward modeling of 3D optical molecular imaging with simplified spherical harmonics approximation using extended finite element method. The final group of papers has highlighted some new imaging modalities and their potential use in clinical practice. The further development of ultrasound-based quantitative imaging of Young’s modulus with high accuracy is presented in this issue. And the novel Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging shows that more detailed classification of brain tissues is clinical significance. We appreciate the many high quality submissions to this special issue from leading researchers in computational biomedical imaging. Because of space limitation, we can only accept a small number of most exciting works. We sincerely hope that the remaining interesting research outcomes will be soon published in other venues.","authors":[{"name":"Huafeng  Liu","ids":["48446895"]},{"name":"Pengcheng  Shi","ids":["1693897"]},{"name":"Yunmei  Chen","ids":["1904069"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2012,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5d8fe304cc7930e00ecd2695b181f724978930b7","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.maths.tcd.ie/EMIS/journals/HOA/CMMM/Volume2012/162892.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42748856","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/46/1f/CMMM2012-162892.PMC3546552.pdf"],"venue":"Comput.

'Surface enhanced Raman scattering' (SERS) nanoparticles (NPs) have been employed as image contrast agents and can be used to specifically target cells in vivo. By tracking their unique “fingerprint” spectra, it becomes possible to determine their precise location. However, while the detection of SERS NPs is very sensitive and specific, conventional Raman spectroscopy imaging devices are limited in their inability to probe through tissue depths of more than a few millimetres, due to scattering and absorption of photons by biological tissues. Here, we combine the use of \"Spatially Offset Raman spectroscopy\" (SORS) with that of \"surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy\" (SERRS) in a technique known as \"surface enhanced spatially offset resonance Raman spectroscopy\" (SESO(R)RS) to image deep-seated glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors in vivo in mice through the intact skull. Methods: A SORS imaging system was built in-house. Proof of concept SORS imaging was achieved using a PTFE-skull-tissue phantom. Imaging of GBMs in the RCAS-PDGF/N-tva transgenic mouse model was achieved through the use of gold nanostars functionalized with a resonant Raman reporter to create SERRS nanostars. These were then encapsulated in a thin silica shell and functionalized with a cyclic-RGDyK peptide to yield integrin-targeting SERRS nanostars. Non-invasive in vivo SORS image acquisition of the integrin-targeted nanostars was then performed in living mice under general anesthesia. Conventional non-SORS imaging was used as a direct comparison. Results: Using a low power density laser, GBMs were imaged via SESORRS in mice (n = 5) and confirmed using MRI and histopathology. The results demonstrate that via utilization of the SORS approach, it is possible to acquire clear and distinct Raman spectra from deep-seated GBMs in mice in vivo through the skull. SESORRS images generated using classical least squares outlined the tumors with high precision as confirmed via MRI and histology. Unlike SESORRS, conventional Raman imaging of the same areas did not provide a clear delineation of the tumor. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of in vivo SESO(R)RS imaging. In a relevant brain tumor mouse model we demonstrate that this technique can overcome the limitations of conventional Raman imaging with regards to penetration depth. This work therefore represents a significant step forward in the potential clinical translation of SERRS nanoparticles for high precision cancer imaging.","authors":[{"name":"Fay  Nicolson","ids":["144860584"]},{"name":"Bohdan  Andreiuk","ids":["6225492"]},{"name":"Chrysafis  Andreou","ids":["48743459"]},{"name":"Hsiao-Ting  Hsu","ids":["3159954"]},{"name":"Scott  Rudder","ids":["102987306"]},{"name":"Moritz F.

Advancements in imaging technology and image informatics have facilitated and enabled quantitative understanding of the biological structures, functional organisms, and pathological mechanisms. \n \nThis special issue presents 14 latest research contributions in computational biomedical imaging. The focuses have been on the computational principles, strategies, methods, and algorithms that create, extract, and understand imaging data of biomedical significance. \n \nThe first group of papers has showcased the development and applications of rigorous optimization techniques in biomedical imaging. The work based on dual unscented Kalman filtering provides a reliable and efficient platform to understand the BOLD signals from fMRI. In the other paper, the robust discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to solve the branch-cut phase unwrapping problem of MRI data. Without the need for a regularization penalty term, a semigreed method for bioluminescence tomography reconstruction is fast and stable for small animal imaging. \n \nThe second group of papers has addressed image segmentation and tissue characterization problems, ever popular among image analysis researchers. The work of L. Li et al. applies machine learning techniques to characterize lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer from gemstone spectral imaging with much improved outcomes, while G. V. Sanchez. Ferrero et al. make new advances in ultrasonic speckle characterization using generalized Gama distribution and generalized Gama mixture model. \n \nIn recent years, physically meaningful modeling and simulation have become integral components for model-constrained imaging and model-based image understanding. Thus, the third group of papers has continued the stride in this direction. The propagation of myocardial electrical activation is simulated using a monodomain model, without the need of explicit mesh constraints. In similar spirit, one work performs forward modeling of 3D optical molecular imaging with simplified spherical harmonics approximation using extended finite element method. \n \nThe final group of papers has highlighted some new imaging modalities and their potential use in clinical practice. The further development of ultrasound-based quantitative imaging of Young's modulus with high accuracy is presented in this issue. And the novel Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging shows that more detailed classification of brain tissues is clinical significance. \n \nWe appreciate the many high quality submissions to this special issue from leading researchers in computational biomedical imaging. Because of space limitation, we can only accept a small number of most exciting works. We sincerely hope that the remaining interesting research outcomes will be soon published in other venues.","authors":[{"name":"Huafeng  Liu","ids":["48446895"]},{"name":"Pengcheng  Shi","ids":["1693897"]},{"name":"Yunmei  Chen","ids":["1904069"]}],"inCitations":["6ecca328d99cca1904e7def793e0b789f846b7b9"],"outCitations":[],"year":2014,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2e6f0ed4fcb679e9d4b81e510c8575ac38e63bef","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41949263","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2014/757380.pdf"],"venue":"Comput.

TTFields are an anti-mitotic modality approved for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Simulation-based studies show that TTFields distribution within the brain depends on the location of the arrays on the scalp as well as the anatomy of the patient. Therefore, to study how field distribution influences disease progression requires the creation of patient-specific computational models. To date the creation of such models is based on accurate segmentation of MRI images into various tissues, and further of volume mesh assembly. These tasks are performed using semi-automatic, labor-intensive algorithms, making this approach impractical for studies which require the creation of a large number of patient models. We recently outlined that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could be used to construct realistic head models for simulating TTFields distribution without the need for complex segmentation of the brain. This is possible because the diffusion tensors evaluated from DTI can be scaled into anisotropic conductivity tensors using simple relationships. However, the approach is limited because the acquisition of high-quality DTI data is not widely practiced for GBM patients. Yet, shorter diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences, such as an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map or trace image, are common diagnostic techniques. The aim of this study was to test whether DWI data could potentially be used to create realistic head models. We used a previously developed head model created from structural and DTI data of a healthy individual. To test pathological scenarios, virtual lesions were placed. To simulate data acquired with DWI, we substituted the diffusion tensor at each point within the model with the mean diffusion (MD), which is the value that can be measured using DWI. The computational model was then completed by scaling the MD into a voxel-wise isotropic conductivity map using the same relationship as applied to convert anisotropic diffusion into conductivity tensors. TTFields distributions within the model were then evaluated for various array layouts and tumor locations. The field distribution within the DWI-derived models did not vary significantly from those found in the DTI-derived models. The highest deviation between models was a difference of 5% in the average electric field intensity in the tumor. The study shows that DWI data can be used to develop realistic head models for simulating TTFields, opening a new avenue for creating patient-specific computational models on a large scale. These models could be beneficial for retrospective studies investigating possible connections between field distribution and disease outcome.

In order to accurately localize and control these different effects, imaging methods are desired that can map both temperature changes and cavitation activity. To address these needs, the authors integrated an ultrasound imaging array into an MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) system to simultaneously visualize thermal and mechanical effects via passive acoustic mapping (PAM) and MR temperature imaging (MRTI), respectively.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe system was tested with an MRgFUS system developed for transcranial sonication for brain tumor ablation in experiments with a tissue mimicking phantom and a phantom-filled ex vivo macaque skull. In experiments on cavitation-enhanced heating, 10 s continuous wave sonications were applied at increasing power levels (30-110 W) until broadband acoustic emissions (a signature for inertial cavitation) were evident. The presence or lack of signal in the PAM, as well as its magnitude and location, were compared to the focal heating in the MRTI. Additional experiments compared PAM with standard B-mode ultrasound imaging and tested the feasibility of the system to map cavitation activity produced during low-power (5 W) burst sonications in a channel filled with a microbubble ultrasound contrast agent.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen inertial cavitation was evident, localized activity was present in PAM and a marked increase in heating was observed in MRTI. The location of the cavitation activity and heating agreed on average after registration of the two imaging modalities; the distance between the maximum cavitation activity and focal heating was -3.4 ± 2.1 mm and -0.1 ± 3.3 mm in the axial and transverse ultrasound array directions, respectively. Distortions and other MRI issues introduced small uncertainties in the PAM∕MRTI registration. Although there was substantial variation, a nonlinear relationship between the average intensity of the cavitation maps, which was relatively constant during sonication, and the peak temperature rise was evident. A fit to the data to an exponential had a correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.62. The system was also found to be capable of visualizing cavitation activity with B-mode imaging and of passively mapping cavitation activity transcranially during cavitation-enhanced heating and during low-power sonication with an ultrasound contrast agent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe authors have demonstrated the feasibility of integrating an ultrasound imaging array into an MRgFUS system to simultaneously map localized cavitation activity and temperature. The authors anticipate that this integrated approach can be utilized to develop controllers for cavitation-enhanced ablation and facilitate the optimization and development of this and other ultrasound therapies. The integrated system may also provide a useful tool to study the bioeffects of acoustic cavitation.","authors":[{"name":"Costas D Arvanitis","ids":["2509273"]},{"name":"Nathan

Techniques","paperAbstract":"Imaging with ionizing radiation is an integral part in today’s medicine. For example, breast tissue is more radiosensitive during puberty and exposures to the chest during that time would impose a higher risk of radiation-induced breast cancer (Doody et al., 2000). The use of ionizing radiation for medical imaging has significantly increased in the past 20 years, which has caused the effective dose per individual in the US to increase from 0.53 mSv in the early 1980s to 3 mSv in 2006 as reported by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement. [NCRP No. 160, 93] This has naturally raised concerns about the possible risks that are associated with multiple exposures from diagnostic sources of radiation. There is a huge effort towards creating imaging modalities that can visualize tissue with a reduced dose to the patient without loss of image quality. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop visualization techniques that employ non-ionizing radiation and that provide comparable high-resolution image quality as the currently available modalities. This is one reason why Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology is gaining so much popularity in spite of the cost and the length of the exams. The non-invasive nature of light in the near-infrared region and its reduced attenuation in tissue are the reasons why optical imaging is gaining popularity. However, tissue scatter is a major limitation in optical imaging techniques. It is possible to combine optical imaging and ultrasound to produce images. This is accomplished by the use of ultra-short laser pulses that are absorbed in the medium, which cause the temperature of the material to rapidly rise and fall. Consequently, the irradiated volume becomes an internal source of ultrasonic waves, which can be used to obtain diagnostic information. Photo-acoustic spectroscopy has been shown to be a great tool to successfully visualize and characterize: • blood vessels (Zhang et al. 2009; Hoelen et al. 1998; Sethuraman, S. et al. 2006); • breast cancer (Ermilov et al. 2009); • brain in vivo (Wang, X. D. et al. 2003; Yang, X. et al. 2007; Lingu et al. 2007); • prostate lesions (Yaseen et al. 2010).

In order to improve the image quality, the concept of high-field and ultra-high-field imaging has been intensively investigated over the last three decades. However, associated with the increased magnetic field strength various problems and challenges occur. The inhomogeneous B1-field distribution and decreased penetration depth into the subject to be imaged are two critical issues. \n \nThe concept of High Impedance Surface (HIS) has been successfully applied in a number of antenna applications. The most relevant achievements are an improved radiation efficiency especially for low profile antennas and a decreased mutual coupling between adjacent antennas or antenna ports. In this thesis, an approach to improve the B1 distribution of radiofrequency (RF) coils in terms of homogeneity and penetration depth by utilizing a HIS shield is presented. \n \nFirst, fundamental investigations are carried out to verify the concept of using a shield with large surface impedance, which is modeled here by a Surface Impedance Boundary Condition (SIBC), to enhance the B1 distribution of RF coils. Different SIBCs are considered and their effects on the electromagnetic (EM) field of RF coils are studied. Next, the shield with a large surface impedance is realized by a periodic HIS structure, where two approaches (multi-layer uni-planar and mushroom-like topologies) are introduced in the lattice design of the HIS structure. The proposed HIS structures are evaluated via their reflection phase and dispersion diagram, which are based on unit cell simulation; as well as the bandgap property based on transmission line (TL) models. Then, the realized HIS shield based on the uni-planar topology is applied to the RF coils, and the concept of using HIS shield to improve the B1 distribution is confirmed through full-wave simulations and experimental results. Additionally, we consider another important parameter for a multi-channel dipole coil array consisting of several array elements—the coupling characteristic of the coil array, especially between the neighboring elements (the worst case scenario). The last chapter provides a brief summary and discussion, as well as an outlook of the future work.","authors":[{"name":"Zhichao

TTFields are FDA approved for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and multi-pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Delivery of TTFields in GBM patients is done by placing two pairs of transducer array on the patient9s scalp. Previous studies has shown that the location of the arrays may have significant influence on the field distribution within the patient9s head and tumor. Planning the placement of the arrays can hence provide better prognosis for patients. As of today, treatment of GBM patients is performed using the NovoTAL system. A new generation of patient specific planning software is currently under development. In order to plan the treatment, a computerized model is created from the patient9s T1 MRI, and various options for arrays layout are simulated. The system can then asses which layout would provide the higher TTFields dose. The accuracy of these simulations may, however, depend on the accuracy of the model. Therefore there is a need to quantify how errors affect TTFields intensity distribution within the model. Methods: To test the effect of model accuracy on TTFields distribution we used a patient specific model (prepared in house) which consisted of the following tissues: scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM). These tissues were automatically segmented using an in-house algorithm utilizing the MARS and SPM Matlab packages. In addition, the tumor, necrotic core and scar tissue were manually segmented into the model. To test the effect of segmentation errors on the field distribution in the tumor, we purposely inserted large defects into the model in the form of conductive (2 S/m) spheres placed at various locations within the model (i.e. WM, GM and CSF). Simulations were performed using Sim4Life v4.4 (ZMT Zurich), and the effect of the defects on the field distribution within the brain and tumor was assessed. Results: Comparison of field distributions in models into which a defect had been introduced with field distributions in the model without the defects revealed that the defects into the model perturbed the field in close vicinity to the defect s with little to no effect on the field distribution in regions that were ata distant from the defect. Typically, introducing a metallic sphere with a diameter of 2cm into altered field intensities up to a distance of abut 4cm from the center of the sphere, with little to no effect on field distributions beyond this distance. Discussion: The introduction of a metallic ball into the model represents the introduction of a very large inaccuracy in segmentation. Nonetheless, the perturbations caused by such inaccuracies seems to influence field distribution only in the immediate vicinity of the defect (up to 2cm away from it9s edge). This suggests that when creating patient-specific models for planning TTFields therapy utilizing simulations, it is important to accurately segment the tissue in the vicinity of the tumor, whereas inaccuracies in regions distant from the tumor are unlikely to affect the field distribution in and around the tumor, and hence unlikely to affect the results of a planning process aimed at maximizing the field intensity within that target region.

However, the inverse problem of DOT and FMT are ill-posed and ill-conditioned due to strong optical scattering in deep tissues, which results in poor spatial resolution for deep target imaging. It is well known that DOT and FMT image quality can be improved substantially by applying the structural guidance in the reconstruction algorithm.In this dissertation, First, I conducted a feasibility study of computed tomography (CT) guided DOT system for breast cancer imaging. I built a noncontact projection style prototype DOT which consists of a laser at the wavelength of 650 nm and an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera. We have validated the CT-guided DOT reconstruction algorithms with numerical simulations and phantom experiments, in which different imaging setup parameters, such as projection number of measurements and width of measurement patch, have been investigated.Secondly, inspired by the kernel methods in machine learning, I introduced a kernel-based image reconstruction algorithm into anatomical image-guided DOT. Compared with conventional Laplacian approaches that include structural priors by regularization matrix, the developed method applied in this research incorporates a kernel matrix with the projection model into the objective function and does not require image segmentation. The optical absorption coefficient at each nite element node is represented as a function of a set of features obtained fromanatomical images such as computed tomography (CT) images. The proposed kernel method is validated with numerical simulations and agar phantom experiments. The proposed method utilized a CT volume data set without segmentation from a clinical breast CT system in the DOT.Lastly, I implemented kernel-based anatomical guidance into the FMT image reconstruction. In FMT, the fluorophore concentration at each node is dened as a function of a set of feature vectors, which is directly extracted from the voxel intensities of the corresponding anatomical 3D images. This research studied the effects of voxel size and a number of nearest neighbors in the kernel method on the quality of reconstructed FMT images. The results indicate that the spatial resolution and the accuracy of the reconstructed FMT images have been improved substantially after applying the anatomical guidance with the proposed kernel method. The proposed method utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rat brain image in FMT simulation, which further proved that we do not need to segment the anatomical image for the kernel method. The proposed kernel method was found to be robust to the false positive guidance in the anatomical image.As future work, the DOT prototype system will be integrated with a dedicated CT system, and clinical trials will be conducted using kernel-based image reconstruction algorithm.","authors":[{"name":"Reheman

Derived parameter maps from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) such as mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) have become a staple contrast in the clinical workflow. Unavoidably, DTI has shortcomings. As the diffusion tensor model assumes Gaussian diffusion―or monoexponential signal decay―it cannot fit signals very well that show nonGaussian diffusion. This is, for example, the case in regions where white matter fibers cross, or in gray matter, where multiple compartments with different diffusion coefficients are present. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) may overcome these problems, because it can account for deviations from Gaussian diffusion, which is expressed as non-monoexponential signal decay in a voxel. When there is excess kurtosis along an axis (expressed as mean kurtosis, axial kurtosis, or radial kurtosis), it is likely that there are more barriers to diffusion because of the presence of cell membranes or myelin sheets in that voxel. DKI therefore provides a more accurate representation of the diffusion signal. DKI-derived parameters have been shown to be more sensitive to pathologies than DTI, for example, in cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, traumatic brain injury, and cerebral infarction. As in all MRI techniques, better signal representation comes at a price: instead of one b-value to be acquired for DTI, a DKI acquisition needs multiple, and higher, b-values. Higher b-values lower the signal-to-noise ratio and increase the acquisition time. Of equal importance in clinical settings is image processing. Processing DKI data is not as straightforward as DTI. DTI processing is available directly on a clinical workstation, while DKI processing is not, and has to be performed with research software like DIPY. The final steps towards implementation of DKI in the clinic are 1) to assess reproducibility, and 2) robustness of the acquisition and processing methods towards heterogeneous patient populations and scanner types. The first step, test– retest reliability of high-resolution DKI measures, was assessed in the article by Kasa et al in this issue of JMRI. What is interesting about this well-executed study is that test–retest reliability was assessed in both 44 healthy volunteers from the Human Connectome Project, scanned in two separate sessions 5 3 months apart, and in 12 3D printed phantoms, scanned twice. The authors split the original datasets with three b-values (1000, 2000, 3000 s/mm) into subsets of (1000, 2000 s/mm) and (1000, 3000 s/mm) to investigate the influence of the number of b-values acquired on DKI reproducibility and fitting quality. The coefficient of variation was <2.8% in the phantoms, while in the white matter it was <10%. The quality of fitting, represented by the difference between the modeled and acquired diffusion data, was consistent across all subsets, indicating that good-quality DKI data can be obtained with two b-values. The most important finding in this study is that using only two b-values (1000, 3000 s/mm) gives similar reproducibility as when three b-values are used. For clinical studies, where scan time is limited and patient comfort is always an issue, this is a very welcome observation. The results from this study provide a good starting point for future studies in patients. Although it must be noted that the data from this study were collected with a modified scanner with high performance gradients on healthy volunteers. A next step, to really bring DKI to the clinic, is to assess the reproducibility on different clinical scanners and form a consensus on acquisition parameters and processing, as, for instance, was done successfully for arterial spin labeling.","authors":[{"name":"Pim

Wang: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT), combining non-ionizing optical and ultrasonic waves via the photoacoustic effect, provides in vivo multiscale functional, metabolic, and molecular imaging. Broad applications include imaging of the breast, brain, skin, esophagus, colon, vascular system, and lymphatic system in humans or animals. Light offers rich contrast but does not penetrate biological tissue in straight paths as x-rays do. Consequently, high-resolution pure optical imaging (e.g., confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy, and optical coherence tomography) is limited to penetration within the optical diffusion limit (∼1 mm in the skin). Ultrasonic imaging, on the contrary, provides fine spatial resolution but suffers from both poor contrast in early-stage tumors and strong speckle artifacts. In PAT, pulsed laser light penetrates tissue and generates a small but rapid temperature rise, which induces emission of ultrasonic waves due to thermoelastic expansion. The ultrasonic waves, orders of magnitude less scattering than optical waves, are then detected to form high-resolution images of optical absorption at depths up to 7 cm, conquering the optical diffusion limit. PAT is the only modality capable of imaging across the length scales of organelles, cells, tissues, and organs (up to whole-body small animals) with consistent contrast.

Integrative. Physiol., Grad. Sch. Med., Osaka Univ., Suita, Japan 2 Dept. Phys. & Elec., Osaka. Pref. Univ. Grad. Sch. Eng., Osaka, Japan An optimal noise enhances the detection of subliminal signals in nonlinear systems through the phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. We have previously shown that the noise can enhance the visual resolution in humans. Here we reinvestigated the effect by using a relative intensity of noise referenced by the noise threshold and a longer distance between an observer and the target signal. Ten undergraduate students participated in the present study. A total of 63 trials were performed for each participant, consisting of 10 trials for each of 6 different noise intensities including null-intensity of noise and 3 catch trials. Participants fixated a small cross, which was presented at the center of the display from a distance of 6 m. A trial started with two brief tones, which served as a ready signal. Two second later, the fixation point was disappeared and the Landort-ring was presented with or without noise for 4 s. One of five noise intensity was used ranging from −20 dB to 20 dB, as reference to the noise threshold for each participant. Two sec after termination of the period the tone was presented for 1 s, which signaled the end of response period. During the response period, participants were asked to respond by pressing one of four buttons, corresponding the gap position of the Landort-ring. The gap positions and noise intensities were tested in a pseudo-random order. Four sec after the response, next trial began. Mean percent correct response significantly increased maximally with an addition of the non-zero intensity of noise. Results of analysis of individual contribution to the mean correct response showed that the noise-induced increase of the correct response rate was found in all of the 10 participants. These findings were well consistent with our previous findings and suggest that the visual acuity can be improved by the addition of noise. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2011.07.641 P2-i19 3D visualization and probing of the probabilistic atlases of human visual cortex Hiroki Yamamoto Grad. Sch. of Human and Environmental studies, Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan Recently I have created two different multisubject maps to characterize interindividual variability in the positions of human visual areas, which were localized using fMRI and coregistered using a surface-based method (Yamamoto et al., Human Brain Mapping, 2011). The first is a probability map representing the degree of alignment inconsistency for each area, in which each point in space is associated with the probability affiliated with a given area. The second, a novel map termed an entropy map in which each point is associated with Shannon entropy computed from the probabilities, represents the degree of uncertainty regarding the area that resides there, and is maximal when all areas are equally probable. In the present study, I have developed a GUI software, called BAVIEW that allows one to view and probe the 3D probabilistic data. Using this software, users can graphically predict the areas that are most likely present at an anatomical point and know the uncertainty associated with such predictions.

The ability to judge time-to-collision allows an appropriate motor response in a wide variety of everyday situations. A previous model study suggested that time-to-collision estimation could be derived in MST using optic flow (Kawakami et al., 2000). We searched for neural substrates for time-to-collision in monkeys’ MST and tested whether MST neurons detected time-to-collision. We also compared their activity with that of caudal FEF neurons. A Julesz pattern of 20 × 20 deg visual angle was presented on a computer display placed 50 cm in front of the animals’ eyes. The pattern expanded at a mean constant velocity of 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 deg/s until it reached a 180 × 180 deg visual angle while monkeys fixated a stationary spot on the screen center. When this expanding pattern was presented to experimenters, the subjects felt that the pattern collided with them at the time it reached 180 × 180 deg visual angle. We recorded 61 pursuit-related neurons in MSTd. Of these, 22 responded to expansion. Of the 22, 12 neurons responded continuously during expansion, indicating that they simply responded to optic flow in depth. The remaining 10 neurons exhibited peak discharge when the expanding pattern reached a threshold distance from the monkeys before the time of collision. The peak discharge time depended on the velocity of pattern expansion and the product of the pattern velocity (v) and time before collision (t) was nearly constant for individual neurons, suggesting that the product (v × t) most probably signaled distance-to-collision. In contrast, the majority of caudal FEF pursuit-related neurons tested (11/20) exhibited peak discharge almost at the time of collision, and the peak discharge time rarely depended on the velocity of the expanding pattern. These results suggest that MSTd and caudal FEF have different roles in estimating time-to-collision from visual motion.

Our hypothesis of the present study is that object-specific regions of the ventral visual area are engaged in the top-down processing and are activated during discriminating deteriorated images with trying to perceive the objects. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a functional MRI with 14 normal volunteers. In MRI scanner, subjects were required to discriminate categories of the deteriorated images which were gradually getting clear. The categories of the deteriorated images were as follow: Human, Scene and Tool. In addition, we identified the three types of object-specific region: Fusiform face area (FFA), extrastriate body area (EBA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA), for each subject with additional fMRI experiments. As results, each object-specific region was activated independently of the kind of stimulus category, while the subjects were discriminating the deteriorated images without perceiving specific objects yet. Once subject identified the object category, the regions whose category specificity did not correspond to the image showed reduced activation while the region whose category specificity corresponded to the object showed maintained or increased activation, e.g., FFA showed increased activation by identifying human images, but showed decreased activation by the other images. On the other hand, primary visual area showed more activation after identifying the images than while discriminating the category before the identification. Our results suggest that the object-specific regions play roles not only to perceive specific objects but also to discriminate deteriorated images providing sources of the top-down information. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2011.07.644 P2-j01 Sparse and heterogeneous codification of sound attributes in rat primary auditory cortex revealed by laminar profile analysis Takeshi Ogawa 1 , Takakuni Goto 1, Akira Sumiyoshi 1, Hiroi Nonaka 1, Karim Jerbi 3, Olivier Bertrand 3, Ryuta Kawashima 1,2, Jorge Riera 1 1 Dept.

dramatic increase in the quantity, quality, and types of advanced biomedical information available to individuals and their medical providers. These types of data include, but are not limited to, cell process information provided by DNA microarrays and RNA seq, genetic information in the form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), metabolomics data in terms of proteins and other metabolites, and structural and functional brain data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Together with the increasing availability of clinical data from electronic medical records, this abundance of data has created the very real possibility of personalized medicine, i.e., using detailed biomedical, clinical, and environmental information about a person for a customized and more effective approach to patient care [11], [16], [3]. Achieving this goal requires identifying those features of the data that can distinguish not only between healthy or low risk subjects (controls) and diseased or high risk subjects (cases), but also among different subgroups of cases. These features are typically predictive patterns (biomarkers) that are associated with the disease or other phenotype of interest. Simple examples are a SNP that indicates a predisposition for a particular disorder or the presence of a protein or small molecule that signals the presence of cancer. These patterns can be directly useful in diagnosis, treatment or prevention, but equally as important; they can also provide insights into the underlying nature of the disease or related biomedical processes. Unfortunately, the lack of readily available, easy to use, and effective tools and techniques for finding trustworthy and useful markers is limiting progress in medical research and slowing the advent of personalized medicine [12], [4]. Several well-known challenges are responsible for this lack of progress. First, many times the large number of individual factors, e.g., hundreds of thousands or millions of SNPs, makes it difficult to find statistically significant single markers without large numbers of samples. In addition, the complexity of the diseases being considered also makes it unlikely that meaningful predictive patterns can be based on single factors. Thus, techniques for extracting meaningful associations must be able to discover combinations of factors that show a significant association with a disease phenotype even when single factors have little or no association. However, search for such high order interactions leads to increased computational complexity, since the number of possible patterns increase exponentially with pattern length. Perhaps an even more serious challenge is that of multiple hypothesis testing which results from the enormous number of potential patterns (hypotheses) and the resulting increased probability of mistaking spurious patterns for real ones. Yet another complication is the heterogeneous nature of many diseases, i.e., patients with a particular disease may form different subgroups and predictive patterns appropriate for one subgroup may not apply to another. To more fully capture the broad range of factors responsible for complex disorders, it is necessary to undertake the difficult task of integrating diverse types of data from the same set of subjects or from accumulated biomedical knowledge, e.g., functional annotations of genes or proteins. Given the inability of current techniques to handle these challenges (computational complexity, statistical significance, heterogeneity, and data integration), it is no surprise the even when statistically significant patterns are found in one study, they are rarely reproduced in follow-up studies by different groups [13], [14], [5]. This talk will present our group's recent research on pattern mining based approaches for addressing these challenges [8], [7], [9], [6], [10], [15], [2], [20], [17], [18], [1], [19].","authors":[{"name":"Gowtham  Atluri","ids":["3119819"]},{"name":"Sanjoy  Dey","ids":["144369079"]},{"name":"Gang  Fang","ids":["144115424"]},{"name":"Sean  Landman","ids":["50419476"]},{"name":"Vanja  Paunic","ids":["2265003"]},{"name":"Wen  Wang","ids":["144962719"]},{"name":"Michael S.

Despite significant efforts to determine the oxygenation state of the human tissue with conventional imaging modalities, e.g. positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a method which is fit for continuous, routine use in clinics does not exist. Near infrared optical tomography (NIROT) is a compelling alternative which can be employed to measure tissue oxygenation. This method is based on the illumination and subsequent detection of the tissue response to light in the near infrared (NIR) spectrum. NIROT is non-invasive and safe for continuous monitoring of patients. However, conventional NIROT systems have demonstrated a limited spatial resolution, in the 1-2 cm range, and prevented widespread clinical uptake. A major reason for this limited resolution is the low numbers of sources and detectors in conventional systems. In an effort to improve the spatial resolution of NIROT, researchers have recently applied time-resolved cameras based on single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) to NIROT phantom measurements, achieving a resolution of 5 mm. Despite these promising results, conventional SPAD cameras are unsuitable for clinical measurements due to a slow image acquisition time. In this thesis, time-resolved cameras were developed which have the potential to perform image acquisitions in NIROT measurements for a multi-source multi-wavelength system in a number of minutes. The main objective was to develop a large format, 252 × 144 pixel, time-resolved SPAD camera capable of wide field measurements in a clinical setting. Two new pixel circuits were developed in a backside-illuminated (BSI) 3D IC technology to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and dynamic range (DR) in time-resolved measurements. The first circuit demonstrates, for the first time, a technique to increase the excess bias range, and thus the photon detection efficiency (PDE) and timing performance of conventional SPAD pixels. \nCoupled to an active recharge circuit, the pixel achieves a minimum dead time of 8 ns, and is thus suitable for high DR measurements. The second presents the first pixel circuit able to interface with a SPAD via the anode or the cathode terminal, thus enabling the possibility of a general purpose time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) die connecting to multiple application specific photodetector dies. A new time-resolved SPAD sensor architecture is presented which employs a time-to-digital converter (TDC) sharing architecture to achieve both high PDE and high throughput parallel measurements. A 32 × 32 sensor based on this architecture is produced in a 180nm CMOS technology. At the maximum throughput, 10^6 photons can be obtained for every pixel in the array in parallel in 4.6 seconds. Finally, a wide-field, 252 × 144 pixel time-resolved sensor is presented. To maintain a fast acquisition speed the architecture includes a per-pixel integrated histogramming readout. This enables the compression of the readout data by up to a factor of 14.9.

has been about 60 years since Watson and Crick first discovered the double-helix structure of DNA. Each genome (about 3 billion long) define every human uniquely (e.g. hair colour, eye colour, etc.) as well as one's genetic diseases. Consequently, there is a need to find the genome of each individual for assessing the genetic risk of potential diseases. At the same time, research groups are sequencing the DNA of all kinds of organisms, e.g., the rice genome in search of higher production yields, the bacteria genome in search of a more effective cure, and the orchid genome in search of more varieties and higher financial returns. To sequence a genome, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology is commonly used to output billions of overlapping DNA fragments (known as reads) from the genome, but without information on how these reads link together to form the genome. Then, effective sequencing software tools are used to combine these reads to form the genome. This process is called \"genome assembly\".Theoretically, genome assembly is an easy task as the chance of mis-matching two reads is extremely low if they overlap 30-40 positions (because of 4^30 >>> 3x10^9). In this talk, we shall review past developments and difficulties of genome assembly and explain why some of the straightforward approaches fail. The most successful and counter-intuitive approach which breaks the reads into smaller parts before assembly will be introduced. Our recent work to develop more efficient algorithms and software tools for genome assembly will also be discussed. 2018 CBEES-BBS TIANJIN, CHINA CONFERENCE 13 Keynote Speaker III Prof. Ming Chen Zhejiang University, China Prof. Ming Chen received his PhD in Bioinformatics from Bielefeld University, Germany, in 2004.

Topic: ―Non-Coding RNAs and their Versatile Interactions)‖ Abstract—Advances in RNA sequencing technologies and computational methodologies have provided a huge impetus to non-coding RNA (ncRNA) study. Previously we developed miRNA target prediction/identification approaches and constructed comprehensive miRNAand miRNA*mediated regulatory networks. In this talk, we provide an overview of ncRNA repertoire and highlight recent discoveries of their versatile interactions. Several ncRNA regulatory network studies are introduced: 1.) the effect of 3D architecture of chromatin on the transcriptional regulation of microRNAs; 2.) miRNA–miRNA functionally synergistic network based on the functions of miRNA targets and their topological features in different cancer cell types; 3.) functional elements embedded in lncRNAs and lncRNA-based regulatory networks; and 4.) circRNA–miRNA–mRNA regulatory networks. Moreover, to better investigate the ncRNA-mediated regulation, we describe a comprehensive workflow for in silico ncRNA analysis, providing up-to-date platforms, databases and tools dedicated to ncRNA identification and functional annotation. 2018 CBEES-BBS TIANJIN, CHINA CONFERENCE 14 Keynote Speaker IV Prof. Hyoungseop Kim Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan Prof. Hyoungseop Kim received his B.A. degree in electrical engineering from Kyushu Institute of Technology in 1994, the Masters and Ph.D. degree from Kyushu Institute of Technology in 1996 and 2001, respectively.

People like Jim Pawley (Pawley, 2006), Colin Sheppard (Sheppard, 1988), Stefan Hell and late Mats Gustafsson (Gustafsson, 2000) and innumerous other dedicated researchers broke the path we have traveled along these years to reach where we are now. Simultaneous technological advances in detectors, design, and efficiency played a critical role in achieving almost 100% quantum efficiency with no photon loss in the system now demonstrated by the Airyscan Superresolution from Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Oberkochen, Germany (Huff, 2015). As famously said by Jim Pawley, “when it comes to microscopy every photon is Sacred.” It is so true that when we compared the optical techniques, any technique where the photon is lost, whether at the in focal plane or out of focal plane, will reduce SNR, and any attempt to compensate that by increasing the laser power and averaging is a perilous path that may destroy the biological sample. However, if the sample is a 3D pattern on an etched Silica or Gold surface and we are looking at a reflected light image, we can close the pinhole as much as possible up to 0.1 AU and increase the laser power and averaging to get a better ( 40% over the limit set by Abbe) resolution and SNR (Pawley, 2006). Yet another quote from Jim Pawley is “If it is not diffraction, it is biology”, is also true; physical principles set forth in optical microscopy are often altered by the absorption and scattering properties of a specimen (Sivaguru, Mander, Fried and Punyasena, 2012) and hence, there is no silver bullet in optical microscopy to suit all scenarios. One has to first carefully evaluate the transparency, absorption, scattering and autofluorescent properties of the sample in hand and decide the target resolution to decipher the appropriate information from the sample before deciding on what optical system to be used (Sivaguru et al., 2012; Sivaguru, Urban, Fried, Wesseln, Mander et al., 2016). In this issue, Sivaguru et al (Sivaguru et al., 2016) compared the performance of the confocal, Airyscan and SR-SIM superresolution techniques using variably absorbing and scattering plant pollen samples (Sivaguru et al., 2012). They found that instead of trying to improve the natural autofluorescent signal available inherently in the sample, a simple procedure of labeling the sample with an appropriate dye could easily increase the SNR substantially. This could help immensely in retrieving the fine surface texture of grass pollen samples, which were previously available only in SEM. Likewise, Urban et al (Urban, Barclay, Sivaguru and Punyasena, 2016) in collaboration with the Smithsonian researchers, were able for the first time to compare the modern and fossil cuticles of trees in Airyscan and SR-SIM superresolution microscopes with labeled and unlabeled samples. They provide a detailed protocol to prepare the samples for these microscopy techniques. Moving on to the live 4D imaging of cancer cells, Kolossov et al (Kolossov, Sivaguru, Huff, Luby, Kanakaraju et al., 2017) explore the imaging of mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, comparing the perils of closing the pinhole in the confocal with the Airyscan Superresolution imaging, which provided 140 nm lateral resolution. In addition to other cell lines, they have used a glioblastoma cell line, which is a same type of brain cancer with which the US Senator John. McCain of Arizona has been diagnosed. Understanding the behavior of these cancer cell lines in an attempt to manipulate the mitochondrial dynamics without affecting their physiological status is important to treat such diseases. That is where more gentle imaging systems are required. GaAsP detectors are great in systems like Airyscan, which is a leap forward (2x sensitivity) compared to conventional multialkali PMTs, but the efficiency could be improved to be closer to EMCCD levels. Minker et al (Minker, Biedrzycki, Kolagunda, Rhein, Perina et al., 2016) present a suitable clearing technique for plant leaves so that the entire 3D image could be obtained using 2-photon microscopy, which is useful in tracking fine fungal filaments penetration strategies. For plant cells in general and leaf tissue in particular, due to the presence of cuticle, leaf hair, chloroplasts, and cell wall, cellular properties are working against the principles required for depth penetration using an optical microscope. Donnarumma et al (Donnarumma, Brodoline, Alexandre and Gross, 2016), on the other hand, present a laser doppler digital holography method that allows the imaging of blood flow in zebrafish. This is a tricky technique given the fact that one has to be fast, as well as navigating the challenges presented by the autofluorescence and other scattering perturbances of the blood and other tissues in intact embryo. Finally, Hoffman et al (Hoffman, Taylor, Aninwene, Sadayappan and Gilbert, 2016) have written a review on Q-space magnetic resonance imaging based on proton diffusion-weighted MRI which in turn reveal the tracks of muscle shape and fiber orientations in an intact mouse heart. With the techniques presented here we hope to give the readers food for thought about conventional as well as unconventional imaging ideas when it comes to imaging biological tissues in both 3D and 4D.","authors":[{"name":"Mayandi  Sivaguru","ids":["4245614"]}],"inCitations":["39f1a3e89f532f9b80540a6d77f3c8c03049da44","5156ef3a19e212cb44c45969db7be5526656adb1"],"outCitations":["66253119249ae0c1fa4a0d1efead3fa45dfd4a4f","324834dad4f57b52b0fa33683e6e3d6bdc8b95f3","4f1df61a72a5fd4f286f052b1338d3d155254987","537c8610b7d104997d8a9abd5c6c2e4217232284","2fdfd9e1c7c4c0287a0f40eca2332e570b503bc0","fef0c74f77ea7a518f348e7eeb186692497f95db","f9048d80c51fd4e04e8b7bd1670a5771a35394cd","49b1c199e1b80d66a0cb30614e5a7517a48e6428","6f2454063265f01cd3c6254006b89f0372315fab","5ea16166220625d5b8da88e84fa19eeca20ed230","510859ecade13c30c9d0a0d232b681c941845f95"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d3d185641050d03a5eaf1c83e214819150609806","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Microscopy research and technique","journalName":"Microscopy Research and Technique","journalVolume":"81","journalPages":"","doi":"10.1002/jemt.22974","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jemt.22974","pmid":"29193436","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science","Medicine"],"magId":"2775018822","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]},{"id":"2801d000cc6c3dff1099e4e67ba3030e0630b994","title":"Editorial message from the editor-in-chief","paperAbstract":"I am pleased to welcome you to the first issue of Volume IX of our journal Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering: Imaging & Visualization.

The already high incidence of AD is predicted to dramatically increase over the years. In fact, the experts claim that it will become a global epidemy by 2050. Consequently, direct and indirect costs related to AD are doomed to dramatically increase. For instance, only in America, AD related burden will overcome the trillion of dollars by 2050. Moreover, available medication (Exelon®, Namenda®, Aricept®, and Razadyne®) produce moderate symptomatic benefits, but do not stop disease progression. Hence, AD, among other neurodegenerative disorders, can be considered an unmet medical need. Neuroprotective drugs, such as, curcuminoids are been taking in high consideration in order to approach these fatal disorders from a protective and preventive point of view. In this context, nanomedicine and, in particular, Polymer Therapeutics (PT) emerge as a powerful alternative to overcome the limitations of low MW drugs including their poor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and low solubility in aqueous solvents, required for i.v. administration. Nonetheless, in the PT field, there is a need to develop new and innovative polymer carriers to be used as drug delivery systems and/or imaging agents owing to the fact that there is no universal polymeric system that can be used in the treatment of all diseases. Apart from biodegradability, the development of novel well-defined architectures with higher MW (in order to increase passive targeting provided by the EPR effect), predictable structure and conformation (defined three-dimensional architecture in solution), higher homogeneity, greater drug loading capacity and increased multivalency is considered crucial. To this respect, polypeptides are envisaged to achieve a major impact on a number of different relevant areas including nanomedicine. Thus, new PT based on amino acids are excellent candidates for drug delivery, as they do not suffer from the previously mentioned limitations. Concretely, polyglutamates constitute a versatile platform, which has been effectively used as building blocks in polymer drug conjugates and polymeric micelles for various medical applications ranging from cancer to regenerative medicine. Moreover, it is expected its FDA approval after approval of PGA-paclitaxel conjugate, OpaxioTM for the treatment of various cancers alone or in combination (OpaxioTM has been recently designated as orphan drug in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme). Nevertheless, control on polymer chain length, polydispersities and stereochemistry has been the major challenge in the development of synthetic polypeptides over the past years. Besides, the use of branched polymers is emerging in order to accomplish the previously described requisites. They exhibit special properties when compared to their linear counterparts. As a result of their different architectures, solution conformation, size and shape as well as greater multivalency, different therapeutic outputs could be gained. Due to their compact and globular shapes they are postulated to perform better regarding to overcome biological barriers, a pre-requisite in neurodegenerative disorders treatment as well as diagnostics due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), one of the most challenging to surpass. Therefore, the main aim of this thesis was the design of new versatile polyglutamate-based nanotherapeutics to be used in the treatment and/or diagnosis of devastating neurodegenerative pathologies such as AD. In order to accomplish our final goal, firstly, we report the development of synthetic pathways to a plethora of functional polyglutamates with well-defined structure, adjustable MW and low polydispersities (? <1.2) applying the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of N-Carboxyanhydrides (NCA) with novel initiators. Furthermore, this methodology has been extended to reach a number of architectures based on PGA, including stars, grafts, and hybrid di-block copolymers. In addition, a versatile post-polymerization modification method to introduce a variety of functionalities such as alkyne, azides, reactive disulfides, maleimide groups or protected amines has been developed, yielding a set of orthogonal reactive attachment sites suitable for further bioconjugations. The physico-chemical properties of the obtained polyglutamates have been exhaustively investigated, in terms of size and solution conformation by the use of a battery of complex techniques including DLS, DOSY-NMR, CD, TEM and SANS. Furthermore, we have developed a novel PGA-based family of systems that, according to their physico-chemical characterization, underwent a self-assembly process where it did exist a structure/conformation-concentration dependency encountering at low concentrations “unimers” of 5-10 nm size, whereas bigger structures of around 100-180 nm were formed at high concentrations. After covalent entrapment of these bigger structures by means of click chemistry, the concentration dependence conformation was clearly eliminated. We have taken profit from that special behavior to develop a strategy in order to reach complex polypeptide based architectures through bottom-up approaches Preliminary in vitro evaluation in selected cell models in terms of biodegradability, biocompatibility and cellular uptake is presented. Furthermore, after an adequate labeling with fluorescence/NIR probes or/and cation complexing moieties towards the use of MRI and/or PET techniques, the in vivo fate (pharmacokinetics and biodistribution) of our polyglutamates is also described. Preliminary results suggest that they were non-toxic entities, validating them as possible carriers for drug delivery. The covalently entrapped unique architectures have been ultimately used to reach carriers for BBB crossing by means of surface modifications with targeting units and imaging agents. Their BBB crossing properties have being explored in vivo, reaching at least 1.2 % of injected dose in the brain. Thus, those results make them optimal candidates to be used in AD treatment. Among all the biological hallmarks of AD, we are centering our efforts in the amyloid pathway, by the use of curcuminoids and with a neuroprotective approach by combining them with the presence of propagyl moieties within the construct. Their biological output regarding cellular uptake, cell viability, drug release profile and biodistribution has been investigated. Moreover, proof of concept of their activity was achieved in vitro, in organotypic hippocampal cultures and is currently being validated in vivo. Finally, the potential of PGA-based conjugates as tissue-specific smart imaging probes is also explored within the frame of the European consortium LIVIMODE. The combination of NIRF enzyme specific smart probes together with the tissue specificity provided by PGA as carrier is explored to be applied in the early detection of disease-related events in vitro as well as in vivo. This strategy could be used for the development of theranostics towards the early detection and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders","authors":[{"name":"Aroa Duro
